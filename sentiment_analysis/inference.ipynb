During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate.

Furthermore, the projection includes an improvement in non-GAAP operating margins by 14.15 percentage points, reaching 42.6% over the same period. Consequently, the non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.2%.\n",

      "On Tuesday, Macquarie maintained its outperform rating on PayPal Holdings Inc . (NASDAQ: ) but reduced the stock's price target to $75 from the previous $77. The adjustment comes as the company focuses on profitable growth, with particular emphasis on branded checkout, payment service provider (PSP) capabilities, operating efficiency, and consumer experience improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "PayPal's management has acknowledged that while they are prioritizing profitable growth, the increasing mix of unbranded transactions is impacting transaction margins. Consequently, transaction margin dollars are anticipated to remain flat year-over-year as the company enters the fiscal year 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm's analysis suggests that PayPal's muted outlook indicates significant challenges ahead. The tone of the management's commentary was interpreted as highlighting structural issues within the company rather than temporary market cycles. This implies that PayPal will have to engage in substantial work to overcome these hurdles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the lowered price target, the outperform rating suggests that Macquarie continues to see potential in PayPal's stock. The firm's commentary indicates a belief in the company's strategic initiatives and their eventual positive impact on PayPal's financial performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors and market watchers will be keeping a close eye on PayPal's progress as it implements its strategy in the competitive digital payments landscape. The company's efforts to enhance its branded checkout and PSP services, along with improving operating efficiency and consumer experiences, are critical to its success in the fiscal year 2024 and beyond.\n",

      "\n",
      "The company's current P/E ratio stands at 15.58, which suggests that it is trading at a low price relative to near-term earnings growth—a point that may interest investors looking for value opportunities.

      "\n",
      "One of the InvestingPro Tips highlights that management has been aggressively buying back shares, which can be a signal of the company's confidence in its future prospects. Additionally, the tip that analysts predict the company will be profitable this year provides further optimism for potential investors. However, it is worth noting that 21 analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, which suggests that there may be some caution in the short-term outlook.\n",

      "\n",
      "On Friday, Truist Securities revised its stance on Rivian (NASDAQ: ) Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN), downgrading the stock from a Buy to a Hold rating. The firm also significantly reduced its price target from $26.00 to $11.00. The adjustment comes as Truist Securities shifts its focus to Rivian's future, particularly in light of the upcoming first shipments of the R2 model slated for 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "The analyst acknowledged Rivian's strong execution and the potential value of its vertically-integrated business model and unique brand. However, concerns were raised regarding the immediate capital needs of the company, which are expected to limit stock growth as Rivian approaches an extended period of plant shutdowns. This is predicted to result in year-over-year volumes remaining flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truist Securities indicated that for investor sentiment to turn positive on Rivian shares again, there would need to be tangible signs of gross margin improvement and robust initial orders for the R2 model. The expectation is that these factors would be necessary to reignite optimism in the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to downgrade Rivian and reduce the price target was also influenced by a reassessment of forecasts, considering the company's near-term challenges and the broader market outlook for Rivian as it prepares for its next major product launch.\n",
