NEW YORK (Reuters) - A ""responsible"" AI image generation startup backed by stock photo provider Getty Images has raised $24 million in a Series A funding round, including from top ad agency Publicis Groupe, it said on Wednesday.

Israel-based BRIA, which licenses more than a billion images from stock providers for its system, said in a press release that it would use the cash infusion to expand globally and build out text-to-video generation capabilities.

The investment, while small relative to others in the white hot AI space, makes BRIA an early test case in how licensing deals can provide a path forward in disputes raging over the use of copyrighted content to train generative AI models.

Music labels, artists and other content owners have pointed to licensing as a more palatable approach to generative AI, after big AI companies built their systems using content scraped off the open internet for free.

BRIA said its license-only approach heads off the risk of trademarks and other fraught elements appearing in its generated images, attracting customers in the advertising, marketing and media world including Publicis.

""There is a way to do this that is both responsible and commercial,"" CEO Yair Adato told Reuters in an interview.

Getty, which has backed BRIA since 2022, has figured prominently in the disputes around training data.

Last year, Getty sued leading AI image generation company Stability AI for using its photos without a license, which it alleged was ""brazen"" infringement of its intellectual property ""on a staggering scale.""

It also teamed up with chip maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) last year to build an image generation service trained only on the images in its own library.

Rivals Adobe (NASDAQ: ) and Shutterstock (NYSE: ) likewise offer AI image generators, while all three photo companies license their visuals to Nvidia for its own service.

BRIA fed its model visuals from 18 stock providers, including Getty, Alamy, SuperStock and Envato. It charges customers for access to the platform and shares revenue with the photo companies.

Each time BRIA generates an image, it displays the original licensed images that contributed data toward that output and accounts for how much came from each.

Adato likens the approach to a Spotify (NYSE: ) model for the AI era, which compensates content owners for their role in enabling the technology.

Controlled training also guards against the technology being used to create misleading visuals that could tarnish brands or influence elections, he said.

BRIA's model, for instance, is not capable of generating an image of U.S. President Joe Biden because it has never been taught what he looks like, said Adato."

By Sheila Dang and Katie Paul

(Reuters) - A group of 20 tech companies announced on Friday they have agreed to work together to prevent deceptive artificial-intelligence content from interfering with elections across the globe this year.

The rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI), which can create text, images and video in seconds in response to prompts, has heightened fears that the new technology could be used to sway major elections this year, as more than half of the world's population is set to head to the polls.

Signatories of the tech accord, which was announced at the Munich Security Conference, include companies that are building generative AI models used to create content, including OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ). Other signatories include social media platforms that will face the challenge of keeping harmful content off their sites, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), TikTok and X, formerly known as Twitter.

The agreement includes commitments to collaborate on developing tools for detecting misleading AI-generated images, video and audio, creating public awareness campaigns to educate voters on deceptive content and taking action on such content on their services.

Technology to identify AI-generated content or certify its origin could include watermarking or embedding metadata, the companies said.

The accord did not specify a timeline for meeting the commitments or how each company would implement them.

“I think the utility of this (accord) is the breadth of the companies signing up to it,” said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta Platforms.

“It’s all good and well if individual platforms develop new policies of detection, provenance, labeling, watermarking and so on, but unless there is a wider commitment to do so in a shared interoperable way, we’re going to be stuck with a hodgepodge of different commitments,” Clegg said.

Generative AI is already being used to influence politics and even convince people not to vote.

In January, a robocall using fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden circulated to New Hampshire voters, urging them to stay home during the state's presidential primary election.

Despite the popularity of text-generation tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT, the tech companies will focus on preventing harmful effects of AI photos, videos and audio, partly because people tend to have more skepticism with text, said Dana Rao, Adobe's chief trust officer, in an interview.

""There's an emotional connection to audio, video and images,"" he said. ""Your brain is wired to believe that kind of media."""

(Reuters) -IRobot shares slumped more than 30% in early trading on Friday after reports that the European Union antitrust regulator was planning to block Amazon.com (NASDAQ: )'s $1.4 billion buyout of the Roomba vacuum maker.

Reuters reported, citing sources, that the agency was considering a veto on the deal, a move that could raise the bar for future Amazon acquisitions of online rivals. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

The U.S. tech giant did not offer remedies until a Jan. 10 deadline to address the regulator's concerns the deal could reduce competition and reinforce Amazon's e-commerce platform dominance.

Amazon agreed to buy iRobot (NASDAQ: ) in August 2022 to beef up its portfolio of smart devices such as the Alexa voice assistant, smart thermostats, security devices and wall-mounted smart displays.

The potential blocking of the deal could weigh on iRobot's prospects as a standalone company, analysts said.

""Regulators have little concern for iRobot's health and financial outlook,"" said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.

""They believe they are preventing harm to consumers by not allowing big technology companies to acquire businesses and make those categories less competitive.""

Meanwhile, a likely rejection would make it the second tech deal to hit regulatory hurdles in recent weeks. Adobe (NASDAQ: ) in December scrapped its $20 billion deal for design software maker Figma, citing ""no clear path"" for antitrust approvals in Europe and the UK.

Amazon in July slashed its offer by about 15% after iRobot incurred fresh debt. That month, the EU warned Amazon the deal, cleared by UK regulators, could reduce competition.

IRobot shares have lost more than 66% since the deal was announced. At $16.27, they are trading at less than a third of the $51.75-per-share amended price that Amazon has agreed to pay.

The European Commission has until Feb. 14 to either approve or reject the deal."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) will begin detecting and labeling images generated by other companies' artificial intelligence services in the coming months, using a set of invisible markers built into the files, its top policy executive said on Tuesday.

Meta will apply the labels to any content carrying the markers that is posted to its Facebook, Instagram and Threads services, in an effort to signal to users that the images - which in many cases resemble real photos - are actually digital creations, the company's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blog post.

The company already labels any content generated using its own AI tools.

Once the new system is up and running, Meta will do the same for images created on services run by OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Adobe (NASDAQ: ), Midjourney, Shutterstock (NYSE: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Clegg said.

The announcement provides an early glimpse into an emerging system of standards technology companies are developing to mitigate the potential harms associated with generative AI technologies, which can spit out fake but realistic-seeming content in response to simple prompts.

The approach builds off a template established over the past decade by some of the same companies to coordinate the removal of banned content across platforms, including depictions of mass violence and child exploitation.

In an interview, Clegg told Reuters he felt confident the companies could label AI-generated images reliably at this point, but said tools to mark audio and video content were more complicated and still being developed.

""Even though the technology is not yet fully mature, particularly when it comes to audio and video, the hope is that we can create a sense of momentum and incentive for the rest of the industry to follow,"" Clegg said.

In the interim, he added, Meta would start requiring people to label their own altered audio and video content and would apply penalties if they failed to do so. Clegg did not describe the penalties.

He added there was currently no viable mechanism to label written text generated by AI tools like ChatGPT.

""That ship has sailed,"" Clegg said.

A Meta spokesman declined to say whether the company would apply labels to generative AI content shared on its encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.

Meta's independent oversight board on Monday rebuked the company's policy on misleadingly doctored videos, saying it was too narrow and the content should be labeled rather than removed.

Clegg said he broadly agreed with those critiques.

The board was right, he said, that Meta's existing policy ""is just simply not fit for purpose in an environment where you're going to have way more synthetic content and hybrid content than before.""

He cited the new labeling partnership as evidence that Meta was already moving in the direction the board had proposed."

Quiver Quantitative - Amazon (NASDAQ: ) recent decision to abandon its $1.4 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot (NASDAQ: ) Corp. marks a significant moment in the tech giant's expansion strategy, showcasing the growing challenges faced by large corporations in navigating regulatory landscapes. The withdrawal, influenced by opposition from European Union regulators who threatened to block the deal, reflects the intensifying scrutiny Amazon is under as its influence extends across retail, cloud computing, and entertainment. This move not only spares Amazon the task of addressing iRobot's recent financial struggles but also highlights the broader shift in regulatory approaches towards tech conglomerates.

The European Commission, known for seeking remedies over outright bans, signaled a tougher stance, prompting Amazon to forego the deal despite a $94 million termination fee. This decision comes amid a larger context where tech firms are re-evaluating their acquisition strategies in light of regulatory pressures, as evidenced by Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s similar move with its planned acquisition of Figma Inc.

Market Overview: -Amazon's planned acquisition of iRobot faced opposition from EU regulators, leading to its abandonment. -The decision reflects increasing regulatory pressure on big tech firms concerning competition and market dominance. -Amazon's move aligns with a broader trend of tech companies rethinking acquisition strategies in response to regulatory challenges.

Key Points: -EU regulators expressed concerns that Amazon could unfairly promote iRobot products, potentially demoting competitors on its platform. -Amazon opted not to offer concessions to address these regulatory concerns. -The merger agreement's expiry and previous renegotiations factored into the decision to abandon the deal. -iRobot has faced financial challenges recently, with net losses accumulating since the second quarter of 2021.

Looking Ahead: -Amazon's withdrawal from the iRobot deal signals a cautious approach to acquisitions amidst a changing regulatory environment. -The focus on antitrust issues and market competition will likely influence future merger and acquisition strategies in the tech sector. -Regulators in Europe and the US are increasingly scrutinizing Big Tech's dealmaking, setting a precedent for future transactions.

Amazon's decision to withdraw from the iRobot acquisition reflects a strategic pivot in an era where regulatory barriers are becoming increasingly formidable. This development underscores the complex interplay between ambitious corporate expansion plans and the regulatory frameworks designed to maintain fair competition. As tech giants like Amazon navigate these evolving landscapes, their approach to acquisitions and market dominance will likely undergo significant recalibration.

The case of Amazon and iRobot serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing the tech industry, where regulatory considerations are now as pivotal as financial and strategic factors in shaping corporate decisions. Looking forward, the tech sector may witness a more cautious and calculated approach to expansion, as companies weigh the potential regulatory hurdles against their growth objectives.

Strategic Growth and Product Segments

Adobe's three core product categories—Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud—remain the cornerstone of its market leadership. The company is strategically positioned to drive new ARR and growth through AI and tools like Adobe Express. Adobe's pricing models, including the introduction of generative credits, are expected to contribute to revenue growth over the medium to long term.

The integration of new generative AI functions into Adobe's application layer is a key factor that could sustain the company's growth amid macroeconomic challenges. The popularity of Firefly, an Adobe product, is on the rise, suggesting potential market share gains. Adobe's leadership has also been proactive in ensuring its generative AI models are copyright compliant, which could give it a competitive edge.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

Adobe's dominant products, such as Photoshop, Acrobat, and Illustrator, have become synonymous with digital content creation, giving it a substantial competitive advantage. The company is seen as a core investment holding due to its defensible moats and potential as a generative AI winner. However, competition from newer market entrants and the potential for regulatory scrutiny, particularly impacting the $20 billion acquisition of Figma, pose challenges.

Future Outlook and Projections

Analysts are bullish on Adobe's future performance, with revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates reflecting confidence in the company's strategic initiatives. Adobe's guidance numbers, while conservative, suggest room for positive revisions if the company outperforms its estimates. The impact of generative AI monetization is expected to be more significant in the second half of FY24, with Adobe outlining a roadmap for further monetization opportunities within its portfolio.

Bear Case

Can Adobe sustain its growth amid competition and macroeconomic headwinds?

Adobe faces potential challenges in maintaining its growth trajectory. With high market penetration, there are concerns about the company's ability to find new growth avenues. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainties could pressure spending in Adobe's key segments.

Will regulatory scrutiny impact Adobe's strategic acquisitions?

The intense regulatory scrutiny over Adobe’s pending acquisition of Figma is a significant factor. Potential harm to innovation and competition could arise, impacting Adobe's ability to integrate and leverage Figma's capabilities.

Bull Case

How will Adobe's generative AI strategy drive future growth?

Adobe's generative AI strategy is expected to drive significant growth, especially with the introduction of generative credit pricing models. The company's robust innovation cycle and integration of AI into its core offerings are likely to retain investor interest and contribute to sustained growth.

What are the implications of Adobe's strong financial performance?

Adobe's strong financial performance, characterized by high margins and consistent cash flow, positions it well for continued investment in innovation. The company's financial strength allows it to navigate market fluctuations and invest in growth opportunities effectively.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, known for his prescient calls ahead of the 2008 U.S. housing market crash, picked up shares of Warner Brothers Discovery (NASDAQ: ) in the fourth quarter of 2023 while closing out a put option position on semiconductor stocks, securities filings released on Wednesday showed.

Burry's Scion Asset Management added 375,000 shares of Warner Brothers Discovery over the quarter. Other new additions included 200,000 shares of restaurant software company Toast Inc, 225,000 shares of discount retail chain Big Lots (NYSE: ) and 154,142 shares of Gen Restaurant Group.

Meanwhile, the fund closed out a put option position on the iShares Semiconductor ETF that in the third quarter of 2023 had a notional value of $47.4 million. Put options benefit from a decline in the underlying shares, though it was not clear if the position was part of a larger trade. The ETF jumped 8.7% over the fourth quarter.

Burry also closed out a put position on Bookings Holdings and a 400,00 share position in automaker Stellantis (NYSE: ) in the quarter.

The positions were revealed in securities fillings known as 13-fs that hedge funds and other institutional investors file at the end of each quarter. While they are backward-looking and do not reveal current holdings or short positions, the filings are one of the few ways to see the portfolios of often-secretive funds.

Shares of Warner Brothers Discovery are down 15% year-to-date, while shares of Big Lots are down nearly 55% over the same time. Toast Inc shares are up roughly 7.5% and Gen Restaurant Group up slightly more than 13%.

Burry's largest holdings overall are Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holdings and JD (NASDAQ: ).com Inc, both of which have fallen 6% or more for the year to date amid concerns over slowing growth in the Chinese economy."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is taking on Build-A-Bear.

Jazwares, the Berkshire Hathaway-owned maker of the popular Squishmallows plush toys, sued Build-A-Bear Workshop on Monday, calling its new Skoosherz plush toy line ""knockoffs"" that infringed its intellectual property rights.

Not to be outdone, Build-A-Bear filed its own lawsuit against Jazwares on Monday, saying Skoosherz are based on its existing plush animals, and that its advertising and marketing since last month's launch make clear who made them.

The dispute marks Jazwares' latest effort to protect Squishmallows from alleged knockoffs and counterfeits, including a lawsuit against online retail platform Alibaba (NYSE: ).

Squishmallows joined the ranks of the world's hottest toys after becoming a viral sensation on TikTok, and winning devotees like Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian.

They have been a part of Berkshire since Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate bought Jazwares' parent, the insurance holding company Alleghany (NYSE: ), in October 2022.

Jazwares sued Build-A-Bear in Los Angeles federal court.

It said Build-A-Bear ""blatantly and intentionally"" undermined its goodwill and created substantial confusion among consumers by copying Squishmallows' look and feel, including ""shaped fanciful renditions"" of animals, ""simplified Asian style Kawaii faces,"" and ""velvety velour-like"" fabric.

""When it comes to intellectual property rights, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery,"" Jazwares' lawyer, Moez Kaba, said in a statement.

According to Build-A-Bear's lawsuit in St. Louis federal court, however, Squishmallows lack a consistent look and feel, and Skoosherz are simply the most recent type of ""soft, pillow-like squishie-type"" toys that have been trending for years.

Build-A-Bear said it launched Skoosherz in anticipation of Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, to tap a market for plush toys that were ""uniquely styled for optimal hugging benefits.""

Neither Build-A-Bear nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for additional comment.

Jazwares wants Build-A-Bear to stop selling Skoosherz and similar products, and pay unspecified triple damages.

Build-A-Bear wants a court declaration that it did not infringe Jazwares' ""trade dress"" rights in Squishmallows, and that any such rights are unenforceable.

Squishmallows were created in 2016 by Kelly Toys. Jazwares bought a majority stake in that company four years later.

The cases are is Kelly Toys Holdings LLC et al v Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc (NYSE: ), U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 24-01169; and Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc v Kelly Toys Holdings LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, No. 24-00211."

By Arriana McLymore, Casey Hall and Lisa Barrington

NEW YORK/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The rapid rise of fast-fashion e-commerce retailers such as Shein and Temu is upending the global air cargo industry, as they increasingly vie for limited air-cargo space to woo consumers with rapid transit times, more than ten industry sources said.

Shein, PDD Group's Temu and ByteDance's TikTok Shop, which recently began online shopping in the U.S., ship the majority of their products directly from factories in China to shoppers by air in individually addressed packages.

And their growing popularity - Shein and Temu together send almost 600,000 packages to the United States every day, according to a June 2023 report by the U.S. Congress - is boosting air-freight costs from Asian hubs like Guangzhou and Hong Kong, making off-peak seasons almost disappear and causing capacity shortages, the sources said.

""The biggest trend impacting air freight right now is not the Red Sea, it's Chinese e-commerce companies like Shein or Temu,"" said Basile Ricard, director of Greater China operations at freight forwarder Bollore Logistics.

According to data aggregated by Cargo Facts Consulting, Temu ships around 4,000 tonnes a day, Shein 5,000 tonnes, Alibaba (NYSE: ).com 1,000 tonnes and TikTok 800 tonnes. That equates to around 108 Boeing (NYSE: ) 777 freighters a day, the consultancy said.

Driven by robust demand for their low-priced apparel like $10 tops and $5 biker shorts, Shein alone accounts for one-fifth of the global fast-fashion market, measured by sales, and has fueled growth of China's e-commerce industry, according to Coresight Research.

Fast fashion now accounts for half of China's total cross-border e-commerce shipments and takes up about one-third of global long-distance cargo aircraft, according to cross-border transportation media firm Baixiao.com.

Shein and Temu's growth is squeezing out space for other industries on air freighters, just as global firms are scrambling to find alternative logistics options due to the Red Sea disruptions.

""When the Suez Canal (crisis) hit, there was no capacity to be bought, because e-commerce has bought it all,"" said an executive at an air cargo carrier, who requested anonymity due to industry sensitivities.

Pronounced demand for air freight from fast fashion started increasing dramatically in the second half of last year, several sources said.

A German logistics source said even large tech firms like Apple (NASDAQ: ) transport only 1,000 tons maximum a day and the growing cargo demand from fast fashion could push out traditional long-term customers, as they vie for limited air capacity.

Some air-freight carriers have responded to the increased e-commerce demand by providing additional charter capacity, ""which is already heavily booked for the long term,"" said a spokesperson for German logistics firm Schenker.

Apple declined to comment. TikTok Shop did not return messages seeking comment.

""Shein is continually optimizing its efforts to ensure the best customer experience and fulfillment efficiency,"" a Shein spokesperson said, declining to elaborate.

THE HUNT FOR CAPACITY

The sudden spike in demand from fast fashion that began last year has lifted air-cargo rates from China and is raising concerns about longer-term capacity shortage.

""Based on what we have seen, this model of (airborne) e-commerce is not sustainable, neither from a profit or environmental standpoint,"" said Guillermo Ochovo, director at Cargo Facts Consulting.

He said both Shein and Temu are now looking more at sea freight due to the high cost of air freight and considering opening warehouses outside of China to shorten transport times to other regions.

Shein has started sending goods to U.S. warehouses to speed up shipping times.

According to Baixiao founder Wang Yongqiang, in a presentation to a Boeing air cargo forum in China in December, supply growth of long-distance freighters cannot keep up with the growth of cross-border e-commerce.

In its 2023 commercial market outlook, Boeing estimated China's air cargo fleet would more than triple to 750 aircraft between 2022 and 2042. Boeing declined to comment.

E-commerce firms are trying airlines directly to secure more capacity, according to the executive at a major air cargo carrier and Unique Logistics.

""Temu, we understand, is looking to lease 12 wide-body freighters. They are scouring the market for any aircraft they can find. We even received a request to our website,"" Marc Schlossberg, executive vice president of Air Freight at Unique, told Reuters.

Temu told Reuters in a statement that it is looking for sellers based in the U.S. and Europe ""to reduce shipping distances and delivery times"" to shoppers.

Airlines and freight forwarders are also contemplating how much capacity to set aside for Temu and Shein's business as shipments and prices fluctuate.

Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer for air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta, said fast- fashion brands are causing a ""trade imbalance"" with large amounts of cargo leaving Hong Kong but merchandise volumes being ""much lower on the journey back across the Pacific.""

The impact of China's new e-commerce giants is ""game-changing,"" said Schlossberg. ""They ... are emerging as the most important drivers in the industry."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street's major indexes rose on Thursday with the S&P hovering near the 5,000-point milestone as investors reacted to earnings reports and U.S. jobs data, and the U.S. dollar gained.

European equities slipped and U.S. Treasury yields rose after a 30-year bond auction.

Oil prices jumped on concerns of a broadening Middle East conflict.

The number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits dipped to 218,000 during the week ended Feb. 3, compared with economists' forecast of 220,000, data showed.

Both U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policymakers, as well as those in some big emerging markets, have been pushing back against expectations of rapid rate cuts as they gauge whether inflation has been adequately tamed.

The likelihood of a Fed rate cut in March slipped 2-1/2 percentage points from Wednesday to 16.5%, according to the CME Group's (NASDAQ: ) FedWatch Tool. The probability a week ago was 36.5%.

""We continue to get positive surprises in the U.S. and we're not getting enough positive surprises in the rest of the world, and certainly not in China,"" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and interest rates strategist at Macquarie in New York."

Alibaba (NYSE: ) Group Holding Ltd., the Chinese e-commerce and technology giant, has been navigating through a complex landscape marked by regulatory challenges, competitive pressures, and shifting market dynamics. Analysts have been keeping a close watch on the company's strategic decisions, financial health, and market performance to provide investors with insights into its future prospects.

Company Overview

Alibaba operates in the competitive China Technology sector, where it has established itself as a leader in e-commerce, retail, internet, and technology. The company has been a subject of interest for its ability to innovate and adapt to the evolving digital economy.

Market Performance and Analyst Ratings

Analysts have expressed varied opinions about Alibaba's stock, with ratings ranging from ""Overweight"" to ""Outperform"" and ""Equal-weight."" Price targets have also differed, with projections such as $138 and $90, reflecting the differing views on the company's valuation and future performance.

The stock has experienced fluctuations, with prices noted at $79.11 on November 16, 2023, and $68.05 on January 18, 2024, showcasing the volatility in the market and the impact of external factors on investor sentiment.

Financial Health and Projections

Alibaba's financial health is closely monitored, with estimated EPS for FY1 and FY2 being a focal point for analysts. The company's market capitalization has been reported at approximately $201.21 billion and $204.568 million at different points in time, illustrating the scale of its operations.

Revenue and net income projections indicate growth, with expectations of revenue reaching Rmb 1,128.9 billion and net income climbing to Rmb 152.2 billion by the fiscal year ending March 2026. Valuation metrics such as the P/E ratio and EV/EBITDA ratios are expected to improve, signaling a potentially more attractive investment proposition in the long term.

Strategic Decisions and Competitive Landscape

Alibaba's strategic decisions, such as the cancellation of its cloud IPO and the restructuring of Alipay, have been critical in shaping its trajectory. The company's leadership is focused on returning shareholder value through buybacks and dividends, while also adapting to the competitive landscape, which includes rivals like PDD.

The shift towards marketplace and advertisement revenues over first-party product sales is a notable strategic pivot, reflecting the company's response to competitive headwinds and market share challenges. This shift is expected to impact Alibaba's financials and has led to revised revenue and EPS estimates for the fiscal year 2024.

External Factors and Regulatory Environment

The regulatory environment in China, particularly the approval of Alipay's restructuring by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is seen as a positive catalyst for Alibaba's share price. However, the company must also contend with increased regulatory scrutiny of internet platforms, which can pose risks to its operations.

Future Outlooks and Projections

Analysts project improved core e-commerce monetization, accelerated enterprise digitalization, and cloud revenue growth for Alibaba. Cloud margin expansion is also anticipated, which could contribute to the company's earnings growth.

However, the company faces risks such as increased competition, higher-than-expected reinvestment costs, and a slower post-Covid recovery that could affect consumer spending. The pace of enterprise digitalization and additional regulatory scrutiny are also factors that could impact Alibaba's future performance.

Bear Case

Is Alibaba facing significant market challenges?

Alibaba's market position has been under pressure due to intense competition and strategic shifts in its business model. The company is experiencing market share erosion, particularly as competitors like PDD gain ground. The strategic move towards third-party marketplace and advertisement revenues, as opposed to direct product sales, is anticipated to affect profitability margins. These factors, combined with a moderated growth trajectory in the Chinese e-commerce sector, present challenges that could impact Alibaba's near-term performance and investor confidence.

How might regulatory changes affect Alibaba?

Regulatory changes in China, including the restructuring of Alipay and the potential listing of Ant Group, have introduced both opportunities and uncertainties for Alibaba. While these developments could lead to positive outcomes for the company, the broader regulatory environment remains a concern. Increased scrutiny of internet platforms and the evolving regulatory landscape could pose risks to Alibaba's operations and its ability to execute its strategic initiatives effectively.

Bull Case

What growth catalysts could boost Alibaba's performance?

Alibaba is poised to capitalize on several growth catalysts that could bolster its performance. Improved monetization of its core e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, could lead to earnings growth. The company is also expected to benefit from the accelerated digitalization of enterprises in China, with its cloud services segment poised for revenue growth and margin expansion. These factors, along with the potential IPOs of Cainiao and Ali Cloud, could unlock significant value for shareholders.

Can Alibaba's strategic decisions lead to long-term success?

Alibaba's strategic decisions, such as the cancellation of its cloud IPO and the restructuring of Alipay, demonstrate a commitment to long-term success over short-term gains. The company's focus on shareholder value through buybacks and dividends, coupled with its ability to navigate the competitive and regulatory landscape, suggests that Alibaba is positioning itself for sustainable growth. These strategic moves could ultimately enhance shareholder value and solidify Alibaba's standing in the technology sector.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

- Leadership in e-commerce and technology sectors.

- Strong core businesses in Taobao and Tmall.

- Anticipated growth in cloud services and digitalization.

Weaknesses:

- Competitive pressures and market share losses.

- Strategic shifts impacting profitability margins.

- Regulatory uncertainties.

Opportunities:

- Potential IPOs of Cainiao and Ali Cloud.

- Accelerating enterprise digitalization in China.

- Improved e-commerce monetization strategies.

Threats:

- Intensified competition from rivals like PDD.

- Slower consumer spending and economic headwinds.

- Ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential policy changes.

Analysts Targets

- Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) - Overweight rating, Price target: $138.00 (November 17, 2023)

- Baird - Outperform rating, Price target: $90.00 (January 19, 2024)

- Morgan Stanley Asia Limited - Equal-weight rating, Price target: $90.00 (January 02, 2024)

The analysis spans from November 2023 to January 2024, providing a comprehensive view of Alibaba's strategic positioning and market prospects during this period.

InvestingPro Insights

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. continues to be a focal point for investors seeking to understand the intricacies of investing in large e-commerce and technology companies. With a market capitalization of $183.98 billion, Alibaba's size and scale remain significant in the competitive landscape it operates in. According to recent data, the company's P/E ratio stands at 13.67, with an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 at a slightly lower 12.44, indicating a potentially more attractive valuation for investors considering long-term positions.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alibaba's low PEG ratio of 0.06 could signal that the stock's price is undervalued relative to its earnings growth potential. This is particularly relevant for investors looking for growth at a reasonable price. Additionally, with a Price / Book ratio of 1.31, Alibaba appears to be trading at a level that could be compelling for value-oriented investors.

On the performance front, Alibaba's revenue growth of 7.28% in the last twelve months leading up to Q3 2024 reflects a steady upward trajectory, despite the competitive pressures and regulatory challenges it faces. The company's ability to maintain a gross profit margin of 37.91% during the same period also suggests a strong operational efficiency that could be a critical factor in its ability to navigate through market fluctuations.

For those interested in further analysis, InvestingPro offers an additional 15 InvestingPro Tips that delve deeper into Alibaba's financials, strategic decisions, and market potential, providing a more nuanced perspective for subscribers.

With the next earnings date slated for May 24, 2024, investors and analysts alike will be watching closely to see how Alibaba's strategic initiatives and market dynamics align with its financial outcomes. The InvestingPro Fair Value estimate of $107.88, when compared to the current price of $71.6, suggests that there might be an upside potential for the stock, which could be an important consideration for investment strategies.

Investing.com -- Main U.S. indexes were mixed on Thursday as investors parsed earnings reports and evaluated the latest jobs data, with the hovering just shy of 5,000.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) shares advanced 11% after the entertainment giant unveiled better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and a $3 billion share buyback.

Shares in Arm (ARM) surged 60% after the chip designer hiked its annual guidance as royalty revenue was bolstered by soaring demand for artificial intelligence.

U.S.-listed shares in Alibaba Group (NYSE: ) slumped 2.6% as worsening conditions in China led the e-commerce behemoth to post lower-than-projected fourth-quarter profit, while a $25 billion increase in its share repurchase program did little to inspire confidence.

Under Armour (NYSE: ) rose 2.8% after the athletic apparel group raised its full-year income guidance, citing receding input and freight costs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -No single stock has embodied the U.S. market’s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: ), leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.

The semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.

Given the company’s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.

“The response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia’s performance. “If Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.”

The company's shares were up around 12% in pre-market trading on Thursday, bringing the company closer to a $2 trillion market valuation.

Nvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That’s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market’s key drivers over the past year.

Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.

The company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the . As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.

Nvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.

Rapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.

The company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.

Nvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) or Comcast (NASDAQ: ).

Nvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.

Options wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia’s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.

While Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology. Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.

Even beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have playing up their exposure to AI. Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme."

(Reuters) -General Motors' self-driving car unit Cruise is preparing to resume testing its robotaxis on public roads with safety drivers in the coming weeks, with Houston and Dallas as potential locations, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

Cruise suspended its U.S. operations in October after an incident in San Francisco, where one of its robotaxis dragged a pedestrian struck by another car.

""We have not set a timeline for deployment. Our goal is to relaunch in one city with manually driven vehicles and supervised testing as soon as possible once we have taken steps to rebuild trust with regulators and the public,"" Cruise spokesperson Sara Autio said in a statement to Reuters.

The company is meeting with officials in select markets to ""gather information, share updates and rebuild trust,"" the spokesperson said.

Reuters has reported that Cruise is seeking to relaunch its service and considering Houston and Dallas as potential locations to resume testing with as few as 10 cars in each city and no passengers.

Labor unions and lawmakers have recently called for stricter regulation of autonomous vehicles after accidents involving self-driving taxis from GM and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Waymo.

In January, Cruise said the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the accident involving its robotaxi in October."

Investing.com -- On Tuesday, Walmart (NYSE: ) announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire VIZIO for $11.50 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $2.3 billion.

The news suggests that Walmart aims to grow its media and advertising presence. But what does it mean for other companies in the industry, such as Roku?

Roku stock price

News of Walmart's acquisition of Vizio resulted in Roku shares (NASDAQ: ) sinking. The stock fell 6.6%, adding to its recent decline following its fourth-quarter earnings report. When rumors of the deal first emerged on February 13, Roku’s shares also took a hit, falling more than 8%.

The slide in reaction to the initial reports and subsequent announcement of the deal comes as investors and analysts see the company facing potentially major challenges. For the year-to-date, Roku’s stock has declined 26.8%.

What do Roku and Vizio do?

If you are not already aware, Roku's streaming devices let users watch entertainment, such as TV shows, movies, YouTube videos, and more from the internet on your TV.

Roku devices connect to users' Wi-Fi networks and provide instant access to streaming services, including Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Hulu, and Disney+.

Similarly, Vizio is a consumer electronics company primarily focused on manufacturing and selling various audiovisual products. Vizio is well-known for its products in smart TVs, soundbars, home theater systems, tablets and other accessories.

Roku stock forecast

Despite the share price decline, analysts at Needham & Company remain bullish on Roku stock, maintaining a Buy rating and $100 price target on the shares in a note reacting to the Walmart acquisition of Vizio.

The firm's analysts stated that they believe the negative reaction in Roku shares following the deal announcement is ""overdone,"" and they are buyers based on several potential upside value drivers they see.

Guggenheim analysts have a Neutral rating on Roku, with the firm keeping a $72 per share price target on the stock in a recent client note.

Is Roku a good stock to buy

According to Needham & Company, yes. The firm listed several reasons for their buy thesis, including ad revenue. They told investors that they believe Walmart's ""full funnel"" ad product will target a different market segment than Roku's CTV ad product. ""Also, because Walmart's ad strategy is to chase Amazon (NASDAQ: ) with closed-loop attribution (lower funnel), Roku benefits by losing VZIO as a direct competitor in its CTV-only (upper funnel) target market,"" they explained.

Needham also believes that once the Walmart deal for Vizio closes, it will lower Roku's competition for shelf space at retailers other than Walmart. Furthermore, the deal could result in takeover interest for Roku if Walmart proves out VZIO's value proposition and closed-loop attribution.

The deal will also result in the value of Roku's CTV data rising and the company being more nimble than Vizio, according to Needham & Company.

Analysts at Needham went on to state that from a valuation point of view, they believe Roku should be valued as a digital video aggregation platform such as YouTube or AAPL's iOS platform.

On the other hand, Guggenheim analysts told investors in a recent note that they “believe the combination creates an incremental competitive challenge for Roku.”

“Walmart is a primary sales partner of Roku-powered TV units, which may be de-emphasized at point of sale,” commented Guggenheim. “In addition, Roku is currently the operating system for Walmart house brand onn, which we assume would no longer be the case following this combination.”

The firm also explained that depending on how Walmart distributes Vizio units going forward, Roku may have an opportunity to take share at other retail partners, including Target (NYSE: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ) and Costco (NASDAQ: ). However, they feel the availability of a potential partner with the scale and technology base of Amazon, Google (NASDAQ: ), or Walmart “is not obvious."""

Redburn Atlantic analysts said in a note to clients Friday that Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) search resilience is underappreciated. The firm lifted its price target for the stock to $170 from $165, keeping a Buy rating on the stock.

The analysts explained that with Alphabet's forward PE now just in line with that of the S&P, sentiment has clearly turned negative regarding Google Search's competitive position and ongoing growth potential.

However, Redburn believes Search is in a ""structurally stronger position than appreciated"" and that there should be upside to Search, Cloud and EPS consensus expectations.

""The strength of Google's Search franchise comes partly from the superiority of its technology, but also from the strength of its market position,"" explained the analysts. ""The combination of its ownership of all key entry points to the internet, multiple years of consumer data, unprecedented breadth of advertisers and every website effectively optimising for Google in combination creates a significant barrier for anyone attempting to match Google's capabilities.""

Given its belief in the strength of Google's search strength, Redburn remains bullish on GOOGL."

On Friday, Redburn-Atlantic, a financial analysis firm, updated its outlook on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: ), the parent company of Google, by raising its price target on the stock to $170 from the previous $165. The firm continues to recommend a Buy rating for the stock. The adjustment comes amid a broader market reassessment of Alphabet's growth potential and competitive stance, particularly regarding its flagship product, Google Search.

According to Redburn-Atlantic, Alphabet's forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio now aligns with the average of the S&P 500 index. This alignment has led to a more skeptical view of Google Search's ability to maintain its competitive edge and to grow further. Despite this sentiment, the firm argues that Google Search is actually in a stronger position than is widely recognized.

Redburn-Atlantic's analysis suggests that there is potential for upward revisions to the consensus expectations for Alphabet's Search and Cloud services, as well as its earnings per share (EPS). The firm's revised year-end 2024 price target of $170 is based on a forecasted 21 times the fiscal year 2025 PE ratio.

The firm's optimism about Alphabet's prospects reflects a belief in the underlying strength of the company's core services. While the market has shown some doubts about Google's future growth, Redburn-Atlantic's stance suggests confidence in Alphabet's ability to outperform expectations.

This price target increase by Redburn-Atlantic is a signal to investors that, despite market skepticism, there may be more value in Alphabet's stock than the current sentiment suggests. The firm's maintenance of a Buy rating alongside the raised target underscores its positive outlook on the tech giant's financial future.

InvestingPro Insights

As Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) garners attention with its revised price target from Redburn-Atlantic, investors are keen on understanding the financial nuances that could influence the stock's performance. According to InvestingPro data, Alphabet boasts a solid market capitalization of $1.8 trillion, reflecting its massive scale and influence in the tech industry. The company's Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 24.84, which adjusts to a slightly lower 23.11 when considering the last twelve months as of Q4 2023. This indicates a valuation that is potentially attractive relative to its earnings capacity.

InvestingPro Tips highlight Alphabet's strong cash position, as it holds more cash than debt, providing financial flexibility and stability. Moreover, the company is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, suggesting that the stock could be undervalued based on its future earnings potential. This aligns with Redburn-Atlantic's positive stance on Alphabet's earnings outlook and its raised price target.

Notably, Alphabet is a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry, which could be a driving factor behind Redburn-Atlantic's confidence in the company's competitive edge and growth potential. Alphabet's robust market position is further underscored by its high return over the last year, with a 58.53% price total return, indicating strong investor confidence and market performance.

By Sheila Dang

(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google said on Thursday it will integrate its Gemini artificial intelligence models into an existing product for advertisers, bringing its advanced AI capabilities to more of the tech giant's customers.

The integration is part of an ongoing effort by Google to infuse generative AI, which can produce conversational text and realistic images, into more parts of its services. On Wednesday, Google said it would bring Gemini to enterprise tools that it offers businesses.

Google said Gemini will improve a product called Performance Max, which automatically finds the best placements for a brand's ads across Google services including email, search and YouTube.

In November, Google introduced AI tools in Performance Max to create images and text for ads, such as descriptions for a brand's products.

With Gemini, brands will now be able to generate longer headlines for ads to capture a consumer's attention, with headlines of up to 90 characters versus 30 characters previously.

Google said its image generation tool for advertisers will also be improved with its AI model called Imagen 2. That will give brands the new capability of creating images that include people.

For example, a florist could generate a photo of a person arranging a bouquet of flowers in seconds, said Brendon Kraham, vice president of search and commerce global ad solutions at Google.

The tool will include safety measures to prevent brands from creating any images of known people, including celebrities and other public figures, or images that depict violence or illegal activities, Google said.

As generative AI has exploded across the tech industry, it has heightened fears that the content could be used to mislead people or result in deepfakes of real people.

Photos created by AI will be watermarked to identify them as synthetic images, Google said."

(Reuters) -Republican former President Donald Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley are competing to be their party's presidential nominee for the 2024 general election, while President Joe Biden is effectively the Democratic Party's nominee. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.

Here is a list of the candidates.

DONALD TRUMP

Trump has leveraged his civil cases and indictments in four criminal cases - unprecedented for a former American president - to boost his popularity among Republicans and raise funds, helping to make him the Republican frontrunner with 64%, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. He scored victories in the early nominating contests of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and is pushing to replace Republican National Committee leadership with his own top allies ahead of the party's July nominating convention.

Trump, 77, has called the indictments a political witch hunt to thwart his pursuit of a second four-year term, an assertion that the Justice Department has denied. Several legal challenges have reached the U.S. Supreme Court regarding his eligibility for the ballot following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and whether he can claim presidential immunity. If elected again, Trump has vowed revenge against his perceived enemies and has adopted increasingly authoritarian language, including saying he would not be a dictator except ""on day one.""

He has promised other sweeping changes, including gutting the federal civil service to install loyalists and imposing tougher immigration policies such as mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship. He has also promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance, vowed harsher curbs on trade with China and suggested he would not defend NATO allies.

NIKKI HALEY

A former South Carolina governor and Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Haley, 52, has emphasized her relative youth compared to Biden, 81, and Trump, as well as her background as the daughter of Indian immigrants.

She had gained a reputation in the Republican Party as a solid conservative who could address issues of gender and race in a more credible fashion than many of her peers. But Trump has increasingly targeted her, lobbing racist attacks at her ethnicity and amplifying false claims about her eligibility for the White House despite her birth in South Carolina.

Haley, who drew 19% support among Republicans in the Reuters/Ipsos survey, has sharpened her attacks on Trump following New Hampshire's Jan. 23 contest and raised $1 million after Trump threatened her donors. She has also pitched herself as a stalwart defender of American interests abroad, citing Trump's praise of dictators, and ramped up her argument that Trump is too chaotic and divisive to be effective.

She has suggested she will stay in the race past the Feb. 24 primary in her home state, where opinion polls show she trails Trump, and her campaign has blasted Trump's proposed RNC changes, saying the political party should be overhauled and its finances audited.

DEMOCRATIC PARTY

JOE BIDEN

Biden, 81, already the oldest U.S. president ever, will have to convince voters he has the stamina for another four years in office, amid poor approval ratings and a special counsel report suggesting he suffered memory lapses. Biden has blasted the report, and his allies say he believes he is the only Democratic candidate who can defeat Trump and protect democracy. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll put Biden at 34%, while Trump garnered 37% — close to the 2.9 percentage-point margin of error.

In announcing his candidacy, Biden declared he needed to defend American liberties and pointed to the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. Vice President Kamala Harris is again his running mate.

The economy will also factor in his reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation hit 40-year highs in 2022 and the cost of essentials is weighing on voters. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but he has received little recognition from voters for the latter.

Biden has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to sanction Russia and support Kyiv, and he has been supportive of Israel in its conflict with Hamas militants in Gaza while pushing for more humanitarian aid. However, he has faced sharp criticism from some fellow Democrats for not backing a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, where Gaza health officials say more than 28,400 people have been killed, thousands of buildings have been damaged or destroyed, and residents have insufficient food, water and medical supplies.

Biden's handling of immigration policy has also been criticized by Republicans and Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs during his administration.

In the Democratic Party's presidential nominating contests, Biden has easily won in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.

DEAN PHILLIPS

Dean Phillips, a little-known U.S. congressman from Minnesota, announced in October he would mount a long-shot challenge to Biden because he does not believe the president can win another term.

The 55-year-old millionaire businessman and gelato company co-founder announced his bid in a one-minute video posted online, saying: ""We've got some challenges. ... We're going to repair this economy, and we are going to repair America.""

Phillips failed to win any delegates in South Carolina and took second place in New Hampshire. He did not appear on the Nevada ballot.

INDEPENDENTS

ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR

An anti-vaccine activist, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination, but he is far behind in polling.

Some recent Reuters/Ipsos polls showed Kennedy could harm Biden more than Trump in the presidential election, where third-party candidates have affected the outcome of U.S. elections even without winning. Trump's six-percentage point lead over Biden in Reuters/Ipsos polling held even when respondents had the option of voting for third-party candidates, including Kennedy, whose support stood at 8%.

Kennedy is the son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid. A surprise Super Bowl ad heavily featuring his connection to his uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, angered his family members and prompted him to apologize.

He was banned from Instagram for spreading misinformation about vaccines and the COVID-19 pandemic but was later reinstated. He also lost a legal bid to force YouTube owner Google (NASDAQ: ) to reinstate videos of him questioning the safety of COVID vaccines.

CORNEL WEST

The political activist, philosopher and academic said in June he would launch a third-party bid for president that is likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.

West, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate, but in October he said people ""want good policies over partisan politics"" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.

JILL STEIN

Jill Stein, a physician, re-upped her 2016 Green Party bid on Nov. 9, accusing Democrats of betraying their promises ""for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don’t even make such promises in the first place.""

Stein, 73, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won."

(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.

Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google (NASDAQ: ).

That has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

Nvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.

The shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the 's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.

Its latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.

The breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.

""I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,"" said one investor, who declined to be named.

Despite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.

""Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,"" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.

""We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -No single stock has embodied the U.S. market’s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: ), leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.

The semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.

Given the company’s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.

“The response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia’s performance. “If Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.”

The company's shares were up around 12% in pre-market trading on Thursday, bringing the company closer to a $2 trillion market valuation.

Nvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That’s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market’s key drivers over the past year.

Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.

The company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the . As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.

Nvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.

Rapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.

The company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.

Nvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) or Comcast (NASDAQ: ).

Nvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.

Options wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia’s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.

While Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology. Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.

Even beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have playing up their exposure to AI. Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme."

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, including artificial intelligence chips, for the first time in a filing with the Securities and Exchange commission late Wednesday.

The Santa Clara, California-based company said that China's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence such as graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs) and networking chips. The company also identified Huawei as a cloud service company designing its own hardware and software to improve AI computing.

Nvidia declined to comment on Thursday.

Huawei developed the Ascend series of chips as a rival to Nvidia's line of AI chips. The Chinese company's main product, the 910B chip, is its main rival to Nvidia's A100 chip, which launched roughly three years ago.

Analysts have estimated China's AI chip market to be worth $7 billion.

Last year, Reuters reported that Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ: ) placed a chip order with Huawei ahead of widely anticipated new rules by the U.S. government tightened restrictions on advanced AI chips exported to China.

Other rivals pointed out by Nvidia include Intel (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ). The chip company also identified several large cloud computing companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: )

Nvidia shares surged 14% in early afternoon trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that topped consensus estimates as strong demand for AI continues."

Investing.com -- On Tuesday, Walmart (NYSE: ) announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire VIZIO for $11.50 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $2.3 billion.

The news suggests that Walmart aims to grow its media and advertising presence. But what does it mean for other companies in the industry, such as Roku?

Roku stock price

News of Walmart's acquisition of Vizio resulted in Roku shares (NASDAQ: ) sinking. The stock fell 6.6%, adding to its recent decline following its fourth-quarter earnings report. When rumors of the deal first emerged on February 13, Roku’s shares also took a hit, falling more than 8%.

The slide in reaction to the initial reports and subsequent announcement of the deal comes as investors and analysts see the company facing potentially major challenges. For the year-to-date, Roku’s stock has declined 26.8%.

What do Roku and Vizio do?

If you are not already aware, Roku's streaming devices let users watch entertainment, such as TV shows, movies, YouTube videos, and more from the internet on your TV.

Roku devices connect to users' Wi-Fi networks and provide instant access to streaming services, including Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Hulu, and Disney+.

Similarly, Vizio is a consumer electronics company primarily focused on manufacturing and selling various audiovisual products. Vizio is well-known for its products in smart TVs, soundbars, home theater systems, tablets and other accessories.

Roku stock forecast

Despite the share price decline, analysts at Needham & Company remain bullish on Roku stock, maintaining a Buy rating and $100 price target on the shares in a note reacting to the Walmart acquisition of Vizio.

The firm's analysts stated that they believe the negative reaction in Roku shares following the deal announcement is ""overdone,"" and they are buyers based on several potential upside value drivers they see.

Guggenheim analysts have a Neutral rating on Roku, with the firm keeping a $72 per share price target on the stock in a recent client note.

Is Roku a good stock to buy

According to Needham & Company, yes. The firm listed several reasons for their buy thesis, including ad revenue. They told investors that they believe Walmart's ""full funnel"" ad product will target a different market segment than Roku's CTV ad product. ""Also, because Walmart's ad strategy is to chase Amazon (NASDAQ: ) with closed-loop attribution (lower funnel), Roku benefits by losing VZIO as a direct competitor in its CTV-only (upper funnel) target market,"" they explained.

Needham also believes that once the Walmart deal for Vizio closes, it will lower Roku's competition for shelf space at retailers other than Walmart. Furthermore, the deal could result in takeover interest for Roku if Walmart proves out VZIO's value proposition and closed-loop attribution.

The deal will also result in the value of Roku's CTV data rising and the company being more nimble than Vizio, according to Needham & Company.

Analysts at Needham went on to state that from a valuation point of view, they believe Roku should be valued as a digital video aggregation platform such as YouTube or AAPL's iOS platform.

On the other hand, Guggenheim analysts told investors in a recent note that they “believe the combination creates an incremental competitive challenge for Roku.”

“Walmart is a primary sales partner of Roku-powered TV units, which may be de-emphasized at point of sale,” commented Guggenheim. “In addition, Roku is currently the operating system for Walmart house brand onn, which we assume would no longer be the case following this combination.”

The firm also explained that depending on how Walmart distributes Vizio units going forward, Roku may have an opportunity to take share at other retail partners, including Target (NYSE: ), Best Buy (NYSE: ) and Costco (NASDAQ: ). However, they feel the availability of a potential partner with the scale and technology base of Amazon, Google (NASDAQ: ), or Walmart “is not obvious."""

(Reuters) - The and eked out another closing record high on Friday, with all three Wall Street benchmarks scoring weekly gains, as artificial intelligence stocks had enough steam to keep the rally chugging along.

AI poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) advanced again, rising 0.4%, and briefly traded above $2 trillion in market valuation for the first time.

Nvidia's gains on Thursday, the session after its blowout earnings, had propelled the chipmaker to add $277 billion in stock market value, Wall Street's largest ever daily gain. Despite a smaller advance on the final trading day of the week, its performance still dominated the market's attention.

""Nvidia is one of the key companies, if not the key company, for driving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.

Saglimbene noted investors have been walking back expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which otherwise could be a headwind for markets. But the performance of Nvidia and other Big Tech has pushed Fed worries into the background.

""The concentration is so intense right now on Big Tech, in particular on Nvidia, that it's looking passed that,"" he said.

Nvidia had pulled up other Big Tech and growth stocks in previous sessions, as investors traded the AI play. Some of these names gave up some gains on Friday, as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) all fell between 0.4% and 2.8%.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), another beneficiary of the AI rally, dropped 11.8% after the server component maker priced its convertible notes.

The S&P 500 gained 1.77 points, or 0.03%, to end at 5,088.8 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 44.80 points, or 0.28%, to 15,996.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.42 points, or 0.16%, to 39,131.53.

A majority of the S&P sectors ended in positive territory. Among the best performers were utilities, as well as materials and industrials. All three climbed between 0.5% and 0.7%.

For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, the Dow rose 1.3% and the Nasdaq finished 1.4% higher.

Carvana surged 32.1% on Friday after reporting its first-ever annual profit, helped by its pact with bondholders to cut its outstanding debt by $1 billion.

Among Friday's decliners, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) shed 9.9% on reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as the media conglomerate battled the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.

Jack Dorsey-led Block jumped 16.1% after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.64 billion shares, compared with the 11.6 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.

Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google (NASDAQ: ).

That has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

Nvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.

The shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the 's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.

Its latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.

The breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.

""I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,"" said one investor, who declined to be named.

Despite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.

""Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,"" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.

""We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online."""

(Reuters) -The and both surged to record closing highs on Thursday, powered by investors piling into growth and technology stocks the day after artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s bumper earnings and outlook.

For the S&P 500 benchmark, it was also the largest daily gain in 13 months. The notched its biggest single-session advance in a year and just missed a record finish.

Investors eagerly bought stocks as Nvidia shares jumped 16.4% after the chip designer forecast a roughly three-fold surge in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips and beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue.

The company's earnings were a major test for the AI-fueled rally on Wall Street that first pushed the S&P 500 above the 5,000 point mark earlier this month. Some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks.

Instead, the S&P 500 ended at a record high, gaining 105.23 points, or 2.11%, to 5,087.03, as did the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed at 39,069.11 after rising 456.87 points, or 1.18%. It was the first time the Dow has ever finished above 39,000 points.

The Nasdaq Composite added 460.75 points, or 2.96%, to 16,041.62.

""As Nvidia goes, so goes the world,"" joked Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.

He noted how Nvidia's earnings performance trounced high market expectations, showing doubters that plenty of juice was left in the AI trade after the recent rally.

""When do you sell - maybe you don't. Maybe there's still room, and I'm happy to sit and ride it out,"" Janasiewicz added.

Nvidia added $277 billion to its market capitalization, beating Meta Platform's $196 billion surge earlier this month as the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history.

Those shorting Nvidia stock were left nursing more than $2.9 billion of paper losses, per data from Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

The benchmark index will finish this year above the 5,000 mark, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.

All but one of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with technology stocks leading gains with a 4.4% increase. The outlier was utilities, which slipped 0.8%

The S&P 500 growth index advanced 3.3%, its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2022.

Shares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), server component supplier Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) jumped between 4.2% and 32.9%.

Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) soared 6.9%, to a record finish, after the software maker for chip designers reported estimate-beating earnings and outlook.

Also posting a record close was the Philadelphia Semiconductor index, with its 5% increase its largest one-day gain since October.

Big Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) climbed between 1.1% and 3.9%.

Elsewhere, vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ: ) jumped 13.5% after surprising investors with a fourth-quarter profit. The stock's technicals also pointed to a bullish outlook.

However, Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) tumbled 25.6% and 16.8%, respectively, after the electric vehicle startups forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on slowdown in demand.

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.93 billion shares, compared with the 11.64 billion average over the last 20 trading days."

Investing.com — Here is your Pro preview of the upcoming major earnings reports next week: Nvidia, Walmart, Palo Alto Networks, and Rivian Automotive.

Nvidia

In what has been deemed the market's greatest test yet this year, NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) will unveil Q4 earnings on Feb 21, after the market closes.

Analysts predict EPS of $4.63 and revenues of $20.52 billion. The company has surpassed earnings expectations for the past four quarters. Its stock price has increased by 46% since the start of the year, reaching a record high of $746 earlier this week.

On Friday, Loop Capital initiated coverage on Nvidia, assigning a Buy rating and setting a price target of $1,200, marking a new Street high. Despite the rise of new silicon providers, including private entities and major corporations like AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ), and the anticipated introduction of Hyperscale specific internal silicon solutions in the coming years, the analyst believes Nvidia's biggest customers are expected to take “everything NVDA can give them in 2024 and 2025.”

Another Wall Street firm, Oppenheimer, increased its price target for Nvidia to $850.00 from $650.00 while maintaining an Outperform rating, in anticipation of another earnings outperformance.

Walmart

Walmart (NYSE: ) is scheduled to release its Q4/24 earnings results on Feb 20, before the market opens. Wall Street analysts expect EPS of $1.65 and revenues of $169.3B.

Earlier this week, BofA Securities reiterated its Buy rating and $190.00 price target on Walmart, noting it sees 'potential F4Q sales upside'.

Meanwhile, Evercore ISI added Walmart to Its Tactical Underperform list,

We believe Walmart is likely to meet Street estimates for F4Q, but see potential near term downside of around mid single digits for the stock due to what we believe is likely to be conservative guide/tone on the consumer.

Our ProTips - exclusive to InvestingPro users - underline Walmart’s strength, highlighting that the company has raised its dividend for 28 consecutive years, 13 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, the stock is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, and it generally trades with low price volatility.

Rivian Automotive

Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) is expected to release its Q4/23 earnings on Feb 21, after the market closes. Analysts anticipate an EPS of ($1.32) on revenues of $1.26B.

According to ProTips, Rivian holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and analysts anticipate sales growth in the current year. However, ProTips also highlights the weak points of the company, such as quickly burning through cash and suffering from weak gross profit margins.

Earlier this week, Barclays downgraded Rivian from Overweight to Equalweight with a price target of $16.00 (from $25.00), noting that the company has a great product, but its technology is not enough to avoid increased signs of demand pressure amid a broader EV slowdown.

Additionally, the bank believes demand softness implies risk from pricing and slower volume growth. As a result, there is a ""longer path to breakeven."" Barclays also sees an ongoing need for capital raises at Rivian. They said the consequences of weak demand are significant.

Palo Alto Networks

Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ) is set to report Q2/24 earnings on Feb 20, after the market closes. Street estimates stand at $1.30 for EPS and $1.97B for revenues.

This week, several Wall Street analysts lifted their price targets on Palo Alto Networks ahead of the announcement.

Jefferies raised the price target on the company to $450.00 from $350.00 while maintaining a Buy rating, noting that Palo Alto is 'capable of meeting elevated expectations'.

Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its price target to $380.00 from $326.00 while maintaining an Overweight rating. Wells Fargo increased its price target on Palo Alto Networks to $450.00 from $280.00 while reiterating an Overweight rating.

Investing.com -- Main U.S. indexes rose strongly Thursday after blockbuster results from AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) helped boost sentiment, ahead of the release of more corporate earnings and important economic data.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today

Nvidia (NVDA) stock soared 15% after the world’s most valuable chipmaker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and outlined a bullish forecast for artificial intelligence-fueled chip demand.

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) all have posted hefty gains, benefiting from Nvidia's strong outlook.

Moderna (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 9.5% after the drugmaker reported a surprise fourth-quarter profit, helped by cost cutting and some deferred payments.

Etsy (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 7% after the e-commerce company warned of a fall in first-quarter gross merchandise sales on weak demand for handcrafted goods and personalized gifts sold at its online marketplace.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped over 27% after the electric truck maker reported annual production guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates and announced deep job cuts.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose 1% after the carrier said it has reached a tentative agreement with Transport Workers Union that represents nearly 18,000 ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo agents.

Royal Caribbean (NYSE: ) stock rose 8% after the cruise operator raised its full-year income forecast, saying it has been encouraged by both the ""demand and pricing environment"" in 2024.

Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ) stock fell 3.7% after the liquefied company posted a 38.5% fall in its full-year LNG revenue, hurt by a fall in natgas prices.

Fiverr International (NYSE: ) stock fell 9% after the online freelance marketplace missed expectations with its fourth-quarter results, while the next quarter's revenue guidance of $92.5 million also underwhelmed.

Wayfair (NYSE: ) stock rose 7% after the online furniture retailer reported a narrower-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and said it returned to positive active customer growth.

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday released a new set of blueprints for making chips that it says could cut the time required to develop data center processors to less than a year.

Arm, whose underlying technology is widely used in the semiconductor industry and powers virtually every smartphone in the world, has been working to take market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) in the market for data central processors, or CPUs.

Arm, which is majority owned by Japan's SoftBank (TYO: ) Group, argues that its CPUs will become the preferred pairing with Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips in many artificial intelligence data centers, which has helped drive Arm's shares up more than 60% this year.

Arm's technology for creating data center processors is already in use by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Ampere Computing, which supplies chips to Oracle (NYSE: ). Arm on Wednesday announced a new generation of designs for the computing ""cores"" - the most central part of a data center chip.

But the larger announcement was that the cores will be offered as part of what Arm calls a ""compute subsystem."" That offering ties together the cores with other offerings from Arm into something closer to a complete chip design. Arm argues that customers can use it to go from an initial idea to a test chip in less than a year.

That's about half the time of a traditional two-year chip development cycle. Arm said that Microsoft already used the subsystem technology to design its ""Cobalt"" chip announced last year.

""That's a huge deal,"" Ryan Shrout of chip research firm Shrout Research said of cutting down development time.

Shrout said that one of the biggest challenges for traditional chip firms like Intel and AMD was keeping a steady design cadence. Now, Arm is offering to do that work for anyone willing to pay for its blueprints, even if they aren't a traditional chip company.

""It's one of the reasons why you're seeing Amazon, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft start to build their own platforms and not just build them once, but iterate on them. They're coming out with new generations relatively quickly,"" Shrout said."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - A global consortium of semiconductor industry groups has asked India to reconsider its plan to push for duties on cross-border digital e-commerce and data transfers at an upcoming global trade meeting, warning that India's stance will stifle its own chip design industry.

Ministers from across the globe are convening for a World Trade Organization meeting in Abu Dhabi early next week to try to discuss several trade-related issues, including extending a moratorium in place since 1998 on applying duties on electronic transmissions.

Developing nations like India, South Africa and Indonesia are set to oppose efforts by U.S. and Europe to extend the moratorium. If no agreement is made, the moratorium would expire this year.

The moratorium collapse would mean tariffs on digital e-commerce and an innumerable number of transfers of chip design data across countries, raising costs and worsening chip shortages, the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) wrote to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

The chips sector is a key plank of Modi's agenda to push India's economic growth, with a $10 billion incentive package in place to boost the Industry.

Duties on data transfers would "" also impede India's efforts to advance its semiconductor industry and attract semiconductor investment, especially as more than 20% of the world's semiconductor design workforce is based in India,"" the group wrote in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.

The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WSC comprises of chip industry associations in regions like the U.S. and China, which represent chip stalwarts such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

New Delhi has said that physical goods like books and videos, once governed by traditional tariff rules, were now available as digital services and should be subject to duties. Developing nations are facing massive loss in potential revenue with such imports from developed countries on the rise, India maintains.

WSC in its letter also urged India to work toward a WTO agreement to permanently prohibit countries from subjecting cross-border data and digital tools to customs duties and procedures.

India's support to renewing the moratorium will ""send a strong signal to semiconductor companies that India is an investment friendly environment,"" the group wrote."

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) added over $129 billion in stock market value late on Wednesday after the chipmaker's hotly anticipated quarterly report beat estimates and sparked gains in other AI hardware stocks.

Nvidia's stock jumped almost 8% after its quarterly outlook exceeded analysts' estimates, along with its January-quarter revenue and profits.

Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services. This made the Santa Clara, California company's outlook a major test of whether Wall Street's AI-fueled rally is likely to continue or potentially reverse.

Following Nvidia's report, server component supplier Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) jumped almost 6%, while Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) rose 3%.

Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology, two more chipmakers benefiting from the surge in AI computing, rose over 2% each in extended trade.

Arm Holding added nearly 6%, now up more than 160% from the $51 price set in its initial public offering in September.

Nvidia forecast current-quarter revenue of $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. That was well above the $22.17 billion predicted by analysts, according to LSEG data.

The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion, beating estimates of $20.62 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.16 vs $4.64 expected by analysts. Net income surged 769% from a year ago to $12.285 billion.

Worries that Nvidia's quarterly report might not meet Wall Street's high expectations in recent days knocked its stock down almost 9% from record highs. Its late-day surge to $724 on Wednesday still leaves its short of its $739 record high close on Feb. 14.

Including Wednesday's after-hours gain, Nvidia's stock has climbed over 40% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. In recent sessions, Nvidia has jockeyed with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) for a spot as Wall Street's third-most valuable company.

Nvidia has also recently replaced Tesla (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's most traded stock by value."

Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Soaring Today

NVDA +0.36% Add to/Remove from Watchlist AMD -2.94% Add to/Remove from Watchlist MSFT -0.32% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

What Happened: Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ: ) jumped 10.9% in the morning session as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.

Nvidia's guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations.

Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.

Is now the time to buy AMD? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

What is the market telling us: AMD's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 22 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for AMD and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 22 days ago, when the stock dropped 7.4% on the news that the company provided fourth-quarter results with revenue guidance for the next quarter falling below Wall Street's expectations.

Specifically, the Data Center segment is expected to see flat sequential growth with ""the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp."" Management provided additional color on the server market during the earnings call, ""So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on, as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious...""

Despite this uncertainty, there were some positive points during the quarter. Revenue growth in the Data Center and Client segments more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded units, leading to a slight topline beat. On the AI front, management hesitated to provide market share projections, suggesting it is still early days. However, it reiterated the market estimate for the Data Center AI accelerator business growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. In addition, the company highlighted its production of AI GPUs (MI300X) to meet growing demand from major players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ). With the AI GPU business expected to surpass $3.5 billion in 2024, there's certainly momentum in this area.

Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company, which likely didn't deliver the level of optimism expected by the market, especially considering the growing wave of investors excited about the new AI prospects and expecting AMD to be a top player in the GPU market.

AMD is up 32.1% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $7,516."

Investing.com -- Nvidia shares soar following a blockbuster earnings release that added fuel to stock market euphoria around the applications of artificial intelligence. The rally pushes up the and Dow to fresh record closing highs, although futures on Friday point to a more subdued end to the trading week. Elsewhere, Reddit makes its filing for an initial public offering public.

1. Nvidia adds $277 billion in stock market value

Artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) added a staggering $277 billion in market capitalization on Thursday, setting a record for the biggest one-day jump in history.

The California-based firm's shares spiked by 16.4% to end the session at a fresh record high of $785.38, pushing up its market value to just under $2 trillion. The single-day addition in Nvidia's stock was itself bigger than the market cap of peer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and eclipsed a $196 billion jump notched by Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) earlier this month.

In total, $65 billion worth of Nvidia shares exchanged hands, making up about a fifth of all trading in S&P 500 stocks, Reuters reported.

Powering the frenzy was a 265% increase in fourth-quarter revenues at Nvidia, as well as commentary from Chief Executive Jensen Huang, who said that demand for AI is ""surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.""

2. Futures subdued

U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline on Friday, pointing to a breather in the rally sparked by the bumper results from Nvidia.

By 03:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the contract, , and were all mostly unchanged.

The main averages on Wall Street -- as well as indices in Asia and Europe -- advanced on Thursday after Nvidia posted a massive spike in revenue and gave a bullish outlook for AI chip demand.

In New York, the blue-chip added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 added 2.1%, with both ended at record closing highs. The tech-heavy , meanwhile, rose by 3.0% -- its biggest single-session jump in a year and slightly under an all-time high closing level.

3. Reddit files for IPO

Reddit unveiled a narrowing loss as it filed its initial public offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday ahead of a highly-anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.

The firm, which was founded in 2005 on the idea of creating ""the home page of the internet,"" plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.” Reddit is aiming to launch its IPO in March, according to recent media reports.

In the filing, Reddit said that the amount of shares sold to retail investors and users on the platform would be ""significant,"" although it flagged that the participation could result in ""increased volatility"" of its market price. Typically, IPOs are mostly bought by institutional investors.

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2023, the social media company reported a loss of $1.54 a share from a loss of $2.77 a share a year earlier, as revenue, which is mainly driven by advertising sales, rose to $804M from $666M a year earlier.

4. StanChart reports 22% annual income jump

Asia-focused lender Standard Chartered (HK: ) (LON: ) clocked a stronger profit for 2023 as it benefited from higher interest rates, with the bank also announcing a $1 billion buyback.

Still, the lender downgraded its income outlook for 2024 and forecast mild increases in its net interest income, citing some economic risks from sticky inflation and potential geopolitical instability.

StanChart’s underlying profit before tax for the year to Dec. 31 rose 22% to $5.68 billion, the group said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its underlying net interest income rose 20% to $9.56 billion for the year.

5. Oil prices dip

Oil prices were lower in European trade on Friday, and were set to close the week a shade lower as concerns over sluggish demand largely offset bets on tighter supplies linked to disruptions in the Middle East.

A string of weak economic readings from across the globe spurred more concerns over slowing demand, especially after data released last week showed the U.K. and Japan both entering recessions in the fourth quarter.

Expectations of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates also weighed on the outlook for demand in the world's largest oil consumer, as several signals from the Federal Reserve showed the bank was in no hurry to begin trimming interest rates.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett left no doubt: He misses Charlie Munger, and so will Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: )'s shareholders.

Buffett on Saturday devoted a special section of his annual shareholder letter to Munger, who died in November at age 99.

The 93-year-old Buffett called his long-time business partner a key driver behind what has become his more than $900 billion, Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.

""Charlie was the 'architect' of the present Berkshire, and I acted as the 'general contractor' to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision,"" Buffett wrote.

Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers Berkshire, called that a ""profound compliment"" from arguably the world's most revered investor.

""Buffett gave Charlie Munger a lot of credit for Berkshire's success and his personal success,"" he said. ""Without his wisdom and guidance, Buffett wouldn't have been as successful as he has been.""

Munger's death deprived Buffett of his closest confidante of more than 60 years, the last 45 as a Berkshire vice chairman.

The two grew up at the same time in Omaha, though Buffett did not meet Munger until 1959.

Under their leadership, Berkshire became the owner of dozens of businesses such as Geico insurance and the BNSF railroad and holder of more than $350 billion in stocks led by Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Munger was known for his common-sense, witty and occasionally acerbic maxims.

""Envy is a really stupid sin,"" he said in 2003, ""because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at.""

But he also became known as the person who changed Buffett's attitude toward investing.

Buffett credited Munger with convincing him to buy ""wonderful companies at fair prices instead of fair companies at wonderful prices"" -- the latter of which Buffett has referred to as ""cigar butts"" because their businesses might still contain puffs of smoke.

Calling him Berkshire's ""architect"" alluded to Munger's passion for architecture, including designing buildings.

Buffett also recalled Munger's relative modesty, saying Munger was okay with letting him ""take the bows and receive the accolades"" while serving more as an older brother or loving father.

One place Munger shared the stage was at Berkshire's annual meeting, where he and Buffett would sit before tens of thousands of shareholders -- and millions more online -- fielding shareholder questions and often finishing each other's thoughts.

Munger's death means Buffett will likely share the stage at this year's May 4 annual meeting only with Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who is slated to eventually become chief executive, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain.

James Armstrong, who leads Henry H Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh and has owned Berkshire stock for more than 35 years, said Buffett's letter was an apt epitaph for Munger and what he meant to Berkshire.

""Charlie's impact was huge,"" he said. ""It may not have been understood by the public, but it is now."""

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) saw its shares soar more than 15% on Thursday following the chipmaker’s yet another blockbuster quarterly report and better-than-anticipated revenue guidance.

According to the financial data firm S3 Partners, this one-day gain cost short sellers roughly $2.9 billion.

NVDA stands as the most heavily shorted entity in the semiconductor sector, with short interest totaling $18.3 billion.

This places it third among the largest short positions in the U.S., trailing only behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) at $20.17 billion and Apple (NASDAQ: ) at $18.72 billion.

“Over the last thirty days we’ve seen Semiconductor sector short interest increase by $1.9 billion to $59.5 billion of total short interest,” S3 noted in a Thursday report.

“Today’s Semiconductor rally, driven by NVDA’s blowout earnings, has produced an AI generated nightmare for short sellers as they are down $4.3 billion in one day mark-to-market losses, down -7.26%. Nearly two-thirds of these losses were the $2.8 billion of losses for NVDA shorts,” it added.

For the month of February, those shorting the semiconductor sector have incurred losses of $7.2 billion, translating to a 12.00% decrease, and a year-to-date loss of $9.7 billion, or -16.8%.

This makes the Semiconductor industry the most negatively impacted sector in terms of short-selling performance for the year so far, S3 highlighted.

For comparison, the Interactive Media & Services sector is down $4.5 billion, while the Biotechnology and the Pharmaceutical sectors saw declines of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively."

By Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: ) is rolling out an upgrade to its iMessage texting platform to defend against future encryption-breaking technologies.

The new protocol, known as PQ3, is another sign that U.S. tech firms are bracing for a potential future breakthrough in quantum computing that could make current methods of protecting users’ communications obsolete.

“More than simply replacing an existing algorithm with a new one, we rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up,” an Apple blog post published on Wednesday reads. “It will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations this year.”

The Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker says its encryption algorithms are state-of-the-art and that it has found no evidence so far of a successful attack on them. Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections.

Late last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed “Q-Day,” both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography. Washington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed “catch now, crack later.”

“Early planning is necessary,” the U.S. cyber watchdog agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a 2022 advisory. “Cyber threat actors could be targeting data today that would still require protection in the future.”

Apple’s blog says PQ3 uses a new and overlapping series of technical safeguards aimed at closing that window of opportunity.

Michael Biercuk, the founder and chief executive of the quantum tech company Q-CTRL, said the fact that Apple was publicly hardening its defenses was a ""vote of confidence"" in the idea that advanced computers could one day lay waste to existing protections.

""They are indicating that they believe this is a realistic threat and are preparing actively for it,"" he said."

(Reuters) - Russia's top consumer electronics chain M.Video-Eldorado has begun sales of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s brand-new Vision Pro headset in its stores, despite Apple halting exports of its products to Russia nearly two years ago.

Apple officially released the device on Feb. 2 in the United States. M.Video did not say how it managed to obtain the devices in Russia.

""M.Video-Eldorado continues to introduce Russians to the latest innovations in the world of gadgets,"" the company said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Store visitors will be able to personally test the new product and learn about its capabilities.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Retailing at $3,500 in the U.S. market, Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset allows users to browse the web, chat and even watch movies at a high resolution.

M.Video, which is offering the version with 256 GB memory for 579,999 roubles ($6,276), said it had opened product testing spaces in stores in six Russian cities, including its two flagship stores in Moscow.

Another reseller, re:Store, was offering the same version for 579,990 roubles, according to its website. It had also opened test-drive spaces in Moscow and was planning more in other Russian cities.

Apple paused all its product sales in Russia in March 2022 in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine while Western-imposed sanctions sought to curb technology exports to Russia.

A Russian tech blogger told CNBC that his team had pre-ordered the devices in New York and flew with them to Moscow.

""Through New York, Istanbul, Moscow, we brought Vision very quickly,"" Sergey Romantsev, who blogs under the name ""Romance768"" told CNBC.

Russians have responded to the exodus of foreign brands with small-scale imports and online sellers helping to keep the goods flowing, particularly consumer items that are not subject to sanctions.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors poured cash into money market funds at the fastest pace on record in the first weeks of the year, and funnelled another $15 billion into equities in the week to Wednesday, Bank of America Global Research said on Friday.

The BofA report showed the equity market rally is broadening beyond the mega caps, as U.S. small cap funds logged their largest weekly inflow in the week to Wednesday since June 2022, at $5.1 billion.

BofA said in its weekly roundup of fund flows in and out of world markets citing EPFR data, that flows to cash were running at an annualised rate of $1.3 trillion in the first weeks of 2024 through to Feb. 21.

Investors can often opt for cash when they are less confident, but with interest rates at elevated levels and looking less likely to drop in the very near term, cash-equivalent money market funds have drawn in flows.

In the latest week, as the hit record highs, investors put $15.2 billion into bonds, including $10.2 billion into investment-grade bond funds, which logged a 16th straight week of inflows, the longest such stretch since October 2021, BofA said.

The S&P this month topped the 5,000-mark for the first time ever, thanks to a surge in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" most valuable stocks that include the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

BofA's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator remained at 6.6 for the latest week, tilting into ""bullish territory"", but the bank said this was not overly stretched.

On a scale up to 10, a reading above 6 is straying into bullish territory and below 5 is moving into bearish territory.

""Positioning (is) not yet at extreme bullish, but (it) won't take too long,"" BofA said in the report.

Last week was also the first time since September that both energy and raw materials funds registered a weekly inflow, according to the report."

The strength of the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks has driven strong mutual fund performance at the start of 2024, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note this week.

The bank explained that following a lackluster 2023, mutual funds are off to a strong start in 2024, with 46% of large-cap mutual funds beating their respective benchmarks year-to-date (YTD), higher than the typical 38% hit rate of outperformance.

""A majority of growth (55%) and value (53%) funds have outperformed their benchmarks,"" explained Goldman Sachs. ""Small-cap funds have performed especially well: 80% have beaten the YTD with the average fund over 100 bp ahead of the benchmark.""

""Effective stock selection has allowed PMs to capitalize on a wide dispersion of returns within the Magnificent 7,"" analysts added. ""While the Magnificent 7 as a group have outperformed YTD, AAPL and TSLA's underperformance provided a boost to fund performance versus benchmarks, offsetting the drag from rallies in NVDA and META.""

(Reuters) - U.S. smartphone sales plunged 10% in January on weak demand for cheaper Android devices and as customers delayed upgrades ahead of the launch of Samsung Electronics (KS: )' Galaxy S24 series, according to data from Counterpoint Research.

The research firm said U.S. smartphone sales last month were nearly half of the record levels seen in the same period in 2017, underscoring fears that the market may have peaked.

""Tough times in the volume-driven low-end coupled with delayed upgrades in anticipation of new products drove the market lower,"" said Maurice Klaehne, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

Smartphone sales have waned after the pandemic-driven boom, as an uncertain economic outlook and lack of major new features led consumers to stick with their existing devices.

Samsung has tried to drum up interest for its new Galaxy smartphones, which went on sale on Jan. 17, by offering multiple artificial intelligence (AI) functions including a two-way voice translation in real-time.

Counterpoint said the S24 series has performed well in the U.S. market during the initial 1-2 weeks of launch, and that it could spark a rebound in smartphone sales in February.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, continued to gain market share in the U.S. last month, thanks to promotional offers for its iPhone 15 series, and as cost-conscious consumers sought its older iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 devices, whose prices have come down.

""This combination is enabling Apple to maintain stability in a market experiencing double-digit declines,"" Counterpoint said."

(Reuters) - The and eked out another closing record high on Friday, with all three Wall Street benchmarks scoring weekly gains, as artificial intelligence stocks had enough steam to keep the rally chugging along.

AI poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) advanced again, rising 0.4%, and briefly traded above $2 trillion in market valuation for the first time.

Nvidia's gains on Thursday, the session after its blowout earnings, had propelled the chipmaker to add $277 billion in stock market value, Wall Street's largest ever daily gain. Despite a smaller advance on the final trading day of the week, its performance still dominated the market's attention.

""Nvidia is one of the key companies, if not the key company, for driving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.

Saglimbene noted investors have been walking back expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which otherwise could be a headwind for markets. But the performance of Nvidia and other Big Tech has pushed Fed worries into the background.

""The concentration is so intense right now on Big Tech, in particular on Nvidia, that it's looking passed that,"" he said.

Nvidia had pulled up other Big Tech and growth stocks in previous sessions, as investors traded the AI play. Some of these names gave up some gains on Friday, as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) all fell between 0.4% and 2.8%.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), another beneficiary of the AI rally, dropped 11.8% after the server component maker priced its convertible notes.

The S&P 500 gained 1.77 points, or 0.03%, to end at 5,088.8 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 44.80 points, or 0.28%, to 15,996.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.42 points, or 0.16%, to 39,131.53.

A majority of the S&P sectors ended in positive territory. Among the best performers were utilities, as well as materials and industrials. All three climbed between 0.5% and 0.7%.

For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, the Dow rose 1.3% and the Nasdaq finished 1.4% higher.

Carvana surged 32.1% on Friday after reporting its first-ever annual profit, helped by its pact with bondholders to cut its outstanding debt by $1 billion.

Among Friday's decliners, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) shed 9.9% on reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as the media conglomerate battled the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.

Jack Dorsey-led Block jumped 16.1% after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.64 billion shares, compared with the 11.6 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.

Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google (NASDAQ: ).

That has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

Nvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.

The shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the 's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.

Its latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.

The breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.

""I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,"" said one investor, who declined to be named.

Despite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.

""Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,"" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.

""We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online."""

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday moved to reassure investors that his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) would serve them well over the long term, even as he mourned the recent passing of his longtime second-in-command Charlie Munger.

In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders Buffett said his more than $900 billion conglomerate has become a fortress that could withstand even an unprecedented financial disaster.

""Berkshire is built to last,"" Buffett wrote.

Still, Buffett tempered expectations for Berkshire's stock price, saying his Omaha, Nebraska-based company ""should do a bit better"" than the average American corporation, but that its huge size left ""no possibility of eye-popping performance.""

""There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,"" Buffett wrote.

The letter was accompanied by Berkshire's financial results, including a record $37.4 billion operating profit and $96.2 billion net profit for all of 2023.

Berkshire's shares have risen by 4,384,748% since Buffett took over in 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually.

The , in contrast, gained a mere 31,223%, or 10.2% annually, though in recent years Berkshire has performed more like the index.

The 93-year-old Buffett assured investors that Vice Chairman and designated successor Greg Abel was ""in all respects ready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow.""

But the billionaire saved his most heartfelt words for Munger, who died in November at age 99.

Buffett called Munger the ""architect"" of Berkshire, with Buffett being only the ""general contractor,"" and reminded investors how Munger pushed him to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices instead of fair businesses at wonderful prices.

Berkshire's ""extreme fiscal conservatism,"" including a reluctance to pay inflated prices, is one reason Buffett let Berkshire's cash stake swell to a record $167.6 billion.

""In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father,"" Buffett wrote, referring to Munger. ""Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never--never--reminded me of my mistake.""

Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Buffett ""wouldn't have been as successful"" without Munger.

STICKING TO ITS KNITTING

Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" said Buffett tried to show Berkshire's ability to withstand rocky shoals, after transforming it from a failing textile company into a colossus mirroring the broader economy.

""Nothing is perfect,"" she said. ""He tried to show there is a succession plan, and Berkshire would stick to its knitting.""

Buffett likened Berkshire's caution, with the stock market now routinely setting record highs, to an insurance policy against hasty, ""dumb"" business decisions that would irk Munger.

Thomas Russo, a longtime shareholder at Gardner, Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said Buffett still offers shareholders ""tremendous value from his ability to make decisions before the opportunity is far gone.""

Berkshire said fourth-quarter operating profit from its dozens of insurance, railroad, industrial, energy, and retail businesses rose 28% to $8.48 billion. Full year profit rose 21%.

The Geico car insurer benefited in 2023 from improved underwriting and cost cuts, including the shedding of 7,700 jobs, or 20% of its workforce, while higher interest rates boosted investment income for Berkshire's insurance units.

That helped offset wage pressures at the BNSF railroad and wildfire losses at Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

""Berkshire has diversified, very solid assets,"" said James Armstrong, a longtime Berkshire investor at Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. ""A mom-and-pop investor can feel that Berkshire is unlikely to suffer permanent harm.""

Investment gains in Berkshire's $354 billion portfolio of stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Bank of America and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), helped generate Berkshire's $96.2 billion net profit.

That amount reflects accounting rules that require Berkshire to report gains in stocks it hasn't sold, however, making it ""worse-than-useless"" to investors according to Buffett.

MARKET EXCESS

Berkshire's caution, and a reason for its record cash stake, was reflected in its having sold about $24 billion more stocks than it bought in 2023.

""His letter is cautioning that other investors may be massively overpaying for stocks and businesses,"" said Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

Results also included some of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: )'s earnings, which reflected Berkshire's approximately 28% stake in the oil company.

Buffett said he expects Berkshire will keep that stake ""indefinitely,"" along with its stakes in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo.

Munger's death means only Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will share the stage with Buffett at Berkshire's annual meeting, where Buffett and Munger spent hours entertaining and answering questions from shareholders, with millions more watching online.

This year's meeting is scheduled for May 4 in Omaha.

Buffett's letter made no mention of portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who have been slated to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after he's gone.

Berkshire's businesses also include industrial parts and chemical companies, a big real estate brokerage, and retail brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's candies."

ARM +3.74% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Friday, Morgan Stanley adjusted its outlook on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), significantly increasing the stock's price target to $107 from the previous $55. The firm has maintained an Equalweight rating on the shares.

The revision follows observations of accelerated growth for Arm Holdings, particularly due to the adoption of AI design and the substantial effect of the ARMv9 architecture on royalties. This performance has exceeded initial expectations, even at this nascent stage of the product cycle.

In light of these developments, Morgan Stanley has revised its financial forecasts for Arm Holdings. The firm now projects higher sales and earnings for the fiscal year 2026, which has been a driving factor behind the new price target.

The ARMv9 architecture, which is the latest offering from Arm Holdings, is contributing to the company's financial uptick. The technology is playing a significant role in the growth trajectory of the company, as it begins to capture a larger share of the royalties market.

Morgan Stanley's updated price target of $107 reflects a doubling from the previous target of $55, signifying a positive outlook on the company's revenue and earnings potential in the coming years. This adjustment is rooted in the tangible growth indicators observed by the firm, particularly in the AI sector and the impact of ARMv9.

ARM +3.74% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Thursday marked a momentous day for Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), as its stock saw an unprecedented rise of 48% in the wake of its much stronger-than-anticipated Q3 results and full-year revenue outlook hike.

According to S3 Partners, this surge led to short sellers incurring $445 million in paper losses. The financial data provider’s analysts pointed out that betting against semiconductor stocks has been unprofitable this year, with short sellers in the sector facing over $7 billion in mark-to-market losses to date.

Remarkably, a significant portion of these losses, about one-fifth, occurred on Thursday alone.

“Shorting the semiconductor sector has not been a profitable trade in 2024 with short sellers down just over $7.00 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, -12.23%,” the analysts said in the report.

“Almost one fifth of those losses were generated today with $1.22 billion in intraday mark-to-market losses hitting profit & loss ledgers,” they added.

Arm's leap contributed a substantial part to the day's overall losses for short sellers in the broader semiconductor industry.

For instance, companies like Broadcom Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., and Monolithic Power Systems Inc. also contributed to the short sellers' woes, each registering daily paper losses exceeding $100 million, as reported by S3.

The analysts highlighted that short interest in Arm is currently valued at $957 million, with approximately 12.4 million shares being shorted.

These shorted shares represent about 1.22% of the company's float, positioning Arm as the 14th most shorted stock within the semiconductor sector."

ARM +3.74% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

In the wake of its much stronger-than-anticipated FQ3 2024 financial results released earlier this month, Daiwa Capital Markets analysts downgraded Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy on Thursday.

However, the analysts raised the 12-month target price on ARM to $130 from $63.

“The quarter was very good, as was guidance, showing the power of the company’s strategic positioning and the strength of their model. This supports our positive view from our October 9, 2023 launch,” the analysts said in a note.

“However, given the material share price appreciation post earnings >60%, >$130 since our launch, we are taking a more conservative approach.”

ARM fell 1.2% in premarket trading Friday.

From a broader perspective, Daiwa said it remains very confident in Arm's strategic position within the AI and semiconductor sectors, a sentiment that is incorporated into their revenue growth and margin expansion forecasts.

The decision to downgrade, however, stems from several factors: notably, the rapid and significant increase in the stock's price over a brief period, which may have been partly driven by a short squeeze, and the current valuation.

“Arm is now one of our most highly valued stocks on a PE and PEG basis in our universe,” Daiwa’s note says."

Investing.com -- Investors await a bevy of quarterly results from big-name U.S. companies this week and assess the outlook for interest rates following strong economic data in recent days. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed will take a ""prudent"" approach to possible rate cuts. Boeing (NYSE: ) flags a new issue with some of its 737 jet models, in the latest setback for the embattled planemaker.

1. Futures edge lower

U.S. stock futures inched down on Monday, as traders geared up for a wave of corporate earnings this week and gauged fresh interest rate commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

By 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the contract had shed 131 points or 0.4%, had lost 15 points or 0.3%, and had dipped by 46 points or 0.3%.

The main averages closed in the green on Friday, bolstered by a January labor market report that was far stronger than economists had initially anticipated. While the data pushed back the expected timeline for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year and subsequently placed upward pressure on U.S. Treasury yields, they were still welcomed by many investors as a sign of resilience in the world's biggest economy.

Also lifting equities in the prior session was a spike in shares in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) following bumper earnings from the Facebook-parent and e-commerce giant. Meta's stock price, in particular, posted its largest-ever one-day jump of 20.3%, sending the social media firm's market capitalization up to $1.2 trillion, according to Investing.com.

2. Earnings wave approaches

The staying power of the stock market rally will likely face another test this week when a stream of big-name U.S. companies unveil their latest quarterly results.

On Monday, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: ) is due to report, with observers keen to find out if the burger chain's profits benefited from cost-conscious patrons opting for its lower-priced value meals. Caterpillar (NYSE: ), the machinery manufacturer that is often viewed as a bellwether for the American industrial sector, is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter and full-year returns as well.

Media firms will also be in focus in the coming days, with results ahead from the industry leaders like Walt Disney (NYSE: ), Fox, Warner Music Group, and The New York Times Company.

Meanwhile, the spotlight will continue to shine on Big Tech after last week's market-moving crop of reports from titans like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Chinese e-commerce player Alibaba (NYSE: ), ride-sharer Uber (NYSE: ), and chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) are slated to report this week.

Hopes are high that the solid economic signals will be reflected in the corporate numbers. According to LSEG data cited by Reuters, earnings are seen climbing by almost 10% in 2024, accelerating from an increase of 3.6% last year.

3. Powell says Fed can be ""prudent"" on rate cuts

The strong U.S. economy can give U.S. central bankers time to take a ""prudent"" approach to possible benchmark interest rate reductions, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in an interview with CBS news program ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday.

Powell added that he would like to ""see the data confirm"" that inflation -- the major focus of an aggressive series of Fed policy tightening that has pushed borrowing costs up to more than two-decade highs -- is cooling back down to the Fed's stated 2% in a ""sustainable way.""

His comments underline a cautious sentiment among Fed officials, who are keen to avoid the risk of reigniting price gains by slashing rates too quickly. Last week, the Fed held rates at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, and stressed that they will need to see more evidence of easing inflation before they start to roll out cuts.

""We have to balance the risk of moving too soon...or too late,"" Powell noted.

He also refrained from declaring that the Fed was all but certain to achieve a ""soft landing,"" a scenario in which elevated price growth is defeated without sparking steep job losses and a broader economic downturn. Instead, Powell called the resilience of the U.S. economy ""historically unusual.""

4. Boeing flags new fuselage issue could delay 737 deliveries

Shares in Boeing were lower in premarket U.S. trading on Monday, after the embattled planemaker warned that a fresh issue in some fuselages of its 737 jets could lead to the ""near-term"" delay of some deliveries.

In a memo to employees on Sunday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Stan Deal flagged that two holes on these models may not have been drilled exactly to the company's requirements.

Deal said that the problem is ""not an immediate flight safety"" concern, adding that all 737s can continue to operate safely. However, he conceded that Boeing will have to perform ""rework"" on about 50 undelivered aircraft.

""[T]his is the only course of action given our commitment to deliver perfect airplanes every time,"" Deal said. ""The days we are setting aside in the 737 program will allow time for our teams to complete the inspections and, if needed, perform the necessary rework.""

Scrutiny over the safety of Boeing jets has been rising since a dangerous mid-air door plug breach on one of its 737 Max 9 planes operated by Alaska Airlines last month. In the wake of the incident, Boeing has not offered a forecast for its 2024 financial year, stating that it still has ""much to prove"" to win back the confidence of regulators and passengers.

5. Crude choppy

Crude prices were volatile on Monday, with investors eyeing the delayed timing of possible Fed interest rate cuts and ongoing violence in Middle East.

By 05:00 ET, the futures traded 0.3% lower at $72.08 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.2% to $77.21 per barrel. Both of the benchmarks slipped at the end of last week due in part to the blockbuster U.S. jobs report, which pushed out expectations for rate reductions this year. In theory, an extended period of tighter financial conditions could weigh on demand in the world's biggest oil consumer.

Analysts at ING said that hopes for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas also contributed to some of Friday's weakness. But they argued that a halt in hostilities ""does not appear imminent.""

The ING analysts added that, despite further U.S. and U.K. attacks on Yemen-based Houthis over the weekend, oil supply ""remains unaffected"" and the crude market ""is largely balanced"" in the first quarter thanks in part to the OPEC producer group sitting on a large amount of spare capacity.

""However, this could quickly change if tensions spread to other parts of the Middle East,"" they said."
Arm,Bernstein raises Arm Holdings stock target on robust AI demand,2024-02-15,06:54,AM,"Published Feb 15, 2024 06:54AM ET

ARM +3.74% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Thursday, Bernstein raised the price target for Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) to $72 from $46, while maintaining an Underperform rating on the stock. The adjustment comes as the firm anticipates the end of fiscal year 2024, citing several factors influencing their outlook.

AI-related demand has been a significant driver for licensing growth at Arm Holdings. However, the company remains cautious about its forecast for fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Although Arm's Flexible Access (AFA) and Automotive Technology Access (ATA) programs have been successful, there has been a noted slowdown in the growth of customer numbers. Bernstein is now focusing on Annual Contract Value (ACV) as a critical metric for future growth.

China, which accounts for an elevated 25% of Arm's revenues compared to 20% in the previous quarter, continues to be a concern. The expectation is for this percentage to decrease in terms of revenue share. The results of the next quarter are expected to provide more insight into market share and royalty rate progress as Arm approaches the end of its first year as a publicly-traded company.

Based on recent results and guidance, Bernstein has increased their top-line projections for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. This revision is driven by higher licensing revenues and an anticipated increase in mobile application processor royalties. The penetration of Arm's v9 architecture is expected to accelerate, with royalties forecasted to reach 5% by fiscal year 2026 and 7% by the end of the decade, an increase from the previous estimate of 5%.

Research and development (R&D) and selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs are expected to revert to levels seen before the acquisition by Softbank (OTC: ), which is slightly below consensus. The adjusted EBIT margin is projected to be close to 50% by fiscal year 2027. Bernstein has shifted their valuation methodology to a Price/Earnings (P/E) basis, aligning with their approach for other companies they cover. They have set a fiscal year 2026 P/E ratio of 40x for Arm Holdings, which is at the higher end compared to peers such as Synopsis, Cadence, and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ). This valuation underpins the increased price target of $72. Despite the raised target, the firm reiterates its Underperform rating on the stock.

Investing.com -- Ford shares climb after the carmaker outlines plans to deliver a supplemental dividend to shareholders, while Snap's stock tumbles on weaker-than-anticipated fourth-quarter revenue at the social media firm. ESPN, Fox, and Warner Bros. Discovery unveil a sweeping joint venture to create a new sports streaming platform. New York Community Bancorp 's overall credit rating is cut to ""junk"" status by Moody's, sending shares to their lowest point since 1997.

1. Futures subdued

U.S. stock futures were muted on Wednesday, as investors weighed an ongoing slew of corporate earnings and fresh interest rate commentary from Federal Reserve policymakers.

By 05:06 ET (10:06 GMT), the contract and were mostly unchanged, while had inched up by 13 points or 0.1%.

The main averages on Wall Street ended Tuesday slightly higher after spending much of the session in the red. The benchmark added 0.2% following a surge in shares in GE HealthCare Technology (NASDAQ: ), which posted stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. The S&P 500 healthcare sector, an index tracking the industry, subsequently jumped to a new all-time high.

Despite facing pressure from a dip in chip stocks -- particularly California-based Rambus (NASDAQ: ) -- the tech-heavy gained 0.1%. The advanced by 0.4%, with hopes for solid air travel demand lifting airlines.

Dampening sentiment were comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Mester said an uncertain inflation outlook had , while Kashkari argued that the central bank's fight to tame elevated inflation is ""not done yet."" Both echoed a similar recent stance taken by Fed Chair Jerome Powell that has all but dashed hopes for an imminent reduction in borrowing costs.

2. Ford drives higher; Snap slumps

Shares in Ford Motor (NYSE: ) climbed in premarket U.S. trading on Wednesday after the automotive giant unveiled a revenue outlook that topped analysts' expectations and vowed to return more cash to its stakeholders.

Michigan-based Ford guided for annual pre-tax income of $10 billion to $20 billion, above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.5 billion. The company added that it would deliver a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter, along with a regular pay-out of $0.15.

But executives told analysts that they were slowing investments on next-generation electric vehicles due to price changes around non-combustion cars in the past year.

Elsewhere, Snap (NYSE: ) shares plummeted by more than 30% after the social media group reported quarterly revenue of $1.36B, missing projections.

Unlike bigger rivals such as Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), the Santa Monica-headquartered business has struggled to overcome a downturn in digital advertising spending during a time of tighter financial conditions. Snap, which detailed plans to lay off 10% of its workforce earlier this week, flagged that its operating environment has been ""challenging.""

A parade of company results marches on later today, highlighted by big names like media titan Walt Disney (NYSE: ), ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies (NYSE: ), and chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ).

3. ESPN, Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery announce joint sports streaming venture

Walt Disney's ESPN, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Fox have said they plan to that will offer lucrative live sporting events.

The as-yet unnamed joint venture will bundle each group's sports networks, certain direct-to-consumer sports services and sports rights, according to a statement from the companies.

They said that the platform aims to provide a ""new and differentiated experience,"" particularly to sports fans who are ditching pay-television for streaming options. The businesses noted that each one would own an equal one-third share of the joint venture, adding that independent management would oversee the service. No pricing was unveiled.

Cord-cutting and weakness in pay-TV demand has increasingly persuaded media groups to consider moving their valuable sports portfolios away from traditional -- and expensive -- cable packages.

""This new product [...] will help prove out how many households that have cut the cord would like to subscribe to a sports-centric and lower priced bundle,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a note.

4. Moody's downgrades New York Community Bancorp

New York Community Bancorp's (NYSE: ) long-term and some short-term issuer ratings have been downgraded to ""junk"" status by Moody's, sending premarket on Wednesday.

The stock, which has already fallen by more than 50% since it reported steep losses from real estate loans last week, touched its lowest level in over two decades following the announcement.

Moody's said the decision stemmed from issues related to ""financial, management and risk management"" at NYCB, adding that the mid-sized lender did not have enough provisions on hand to cover possible loan losses. The bank has been under scrutiny as well in the wake of the recent departure of its chief risk officer.

NYCB's troubles have threatened to reignite concerns over the exposure regional lenders have to a post-pandemic drop in commercial property values. For its part, NYCB has said it is taking ""decisive actions"" to fortify its balance sheet and strengthen risk management processes.

5. Oil prices rise with Middle East conflict, U.S. production in focus

Oil prices rose slightly in European trade on Wednesday as investors sought more cues on U.S. production and inventories from official data due later in the day, while focus remained on ongoing ceasefire negotiations in the Israel-Hamas war.

Forecasts for a potential drop in U.S. output from record highs has spurred some strength this week in oil prices, which were otherwise reeling from steep losses fueled by speculation over an end to disruptions in the Middle East.

A softer dollar also afforded some relief to crude prices, with the greenback retreating from almost three-month highs reached earlier in the week. The strength in the dollar was driven chiefly by expectations of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates.

expiring in April gained 0.6% to $79.09 a barrel, while crude futures edged up 0.7% to $73.86 per barrel by 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT). Both contracts slumped over 7% each last week."

In the rapidly evolving semiconductor landscape, ARM Holdings (LON: ) stands out as a prominent player, crafting an intriguing story for investors keeping a keen eye on the technology sector. This deep-dive analysis consolidates the latest insights from industry analysts, examining ARM's performance, market trends, competitive landscape, and future outlook.

Company Overview

ARM Holdings, headquartered in Cambridge, UK, is a semiconductor intellectual property (IP) powerhouse. The company's designs are a cornerstone of modern electronics, with its CPU and GPU architectures found in over 99% of smartphones in 2022 and embedded in more than 250 billion chips worldwide. ARM's influence extends beyond mobile devices, reaching into automotive, industrial IoT, and communication infrastructure markets. The company's open-licensing model and continuous R&D efforts have solidified its position with tier 1 customers and paved the way for diversification into high-growth areas.

Market Performance and Analyst Ratings

ARM's financial performance has been under the microscope, especially following its recent initial public offering (IPO). Analysts have weighed in with varying perspectives, setting price targets ranging from $46 to $70, reflecting the company's potential in different market scenarios. The consensus leans towards an optimistic outlook, with most analysts assigning ratings from ""Market Perform"" to ""Overweight,"" indicating confidence in ARM's strategic direction and growth potential.

Financial Health and Projections

The company's financial health is robust, with record bookings and a backlog growth of over 40% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, signaling strong demand for its technologies. ARM's revenue for FY24 is expected to hit $3,020 million, with an anticipated increase to $3,754 million in FY25. A non-GAAP operating margin of 38% is projected for FY24, with a bull-case scenario suggesting a surge to 60% by FY28. Analysts forecast a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18%+ and an EPS CAGR of 40% over the next three years, underscoring the company's earnings expansion capabilities.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

ARM's market dominance is challenged by the emergence of open-source architectures like RISC-V and the evolving geopolitical landscape, particularly concerning ARM China. Despite these challenges, ARM's shift from x86 to RISC-based compute IP and its role in AI-related compute markets position it well to capitalize on industry trends. The company's transition to the ARMv9 architecture, which already accounts for 10% of royalty revenues, is expected to bolster growth further.

Product Segments and Strategy

ARM's product segments are diverse, with significant advancements in CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, and interconnect technologies. The company's strategy revolves around high-performance, cost-efficient, and energy-saving products that cater to a broad range of applications. ARM's recent earnings beat and its strategic moves, such as the development of CPUs for Windows PCs, indicate its ambition to expand its footprint beyond mobile devices and into the lucrative PC market.

External Factors and Regulatory Environment

External factors, including the development of China's domestic chip industry and the broader shift towards AI and machine learning, are likely to impact ARM's trajectory. Regulatory environments across different geographies also play a crucial role in shaping the company's operations, with ARM needing to navigate complex trade dynamics and intellectual property laws.

Management and Corporate Strategy

ARM's management team has been steering the company through its post-IPO phase with a focus on sustainable growth. The corporate strategy emphasizes innovation, customer diversification, and penetration into new market segments while maintaining a competitive edge through its licensing model.

Upcoming Product Launches

ARM has not publicly detailed specific upcoming product launches. However, its consistent track record of innovation suggests that the market can expect new product announcements that will likely drive future revenue streams.

Stock Performance

ARM's stock has been under observation, with its price fluctuating post-IPO. Analysts have set a range of price targets based on various performance metrics and future projections. While specific stock prices and ranges are not the focus of this analysis, ARM's overall market performance reflects a positive trend in investor sentiment.

Analyst Outlooks and Reasonings

Analysts are generally bullish on ARM, citing its leadership in RISC-based compute innovation, potential for significant EPS growth, and diversification into high-growth markets. The company's top-line growth is expected to accelerate, with long-term revenue growth potential estimated at 10-12%.

Bear Case

Is ARM's royalty revenue outlook a concern?

Analysts from HSBC and Bernstein have raised concerns about ARM's royalty revenue outlook, particularly in comparison to peers like MediaTek and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ). The weak smartphone market may dampen royalty growth, despite the company's solid licensing revenue. Additionally, higher one-off operating expenses could impact margins in the short term.

Can ARM navigate the competitive pressures from RISC-V and geopolitical risks?

The growing adoption of the open-source RISC-V architecture poses a threat to ARM's market share. Geopolitical tensions, especially regarding ARM China, add another layer of risk. ARM must continue to innovate and adapt to maintain its leadership position in the face of these competitive pressures.

Bull Case

How will ARM's expansion into new markets affect its growth?

ARM's diversification strategy into automotive, IoT, and datacenter compute is expected to drive a high-teens revenue CAGR over the next three years. This expansion, coupled with ARM's strong margins and earnings potential, presents a bullish case for the company's growth trajectory.

What impact will ARM's technological advancements have on its market position?

The transition to ARMv9 architecture and ARM's focus on accelerated compute and AI across multiple end markets are set to contribute to the company's growth. ARM's technological advancements are likely to reinforce its market leadership and drive revenue and EPS growth.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

- Dominant market presence in smartphone IP.

On Friday, Daiwa Securities revised its stance on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), moving the stock's rating from ""Buy"" to ""Neutral."" Accompanying this change, the firm significantly increased the price target for Arm Holdings to $130.00, up from the previous $63.00.

The adjustment followed a period of substantial share price appreciation for Arm Holdings, which saw an increase of over 60%, surpassing $130 since the firm's initial coverage started on October 9, 2023. The analyst acknowledged the company's robust quarterly performance and guidance, which highlighted the strength of Arm Holdings' strategic positioning and business model. These factors had previously supported Daiwa's optimistic view of the company.

Despite the positive assessment of Arm Holdings' recent performance, Daiwa Securities adopted a more conservative outlook due to the rapid rise in the company's share price. The firm's analyst believes that the current share price can be sustained, noting the tight 90% ownership of the stock.

Investors may note the significant revision in the price target, which more than doubles the previous figure. This new target aligns with the current trading level of Arm Holdings' shares, reflecting the company's recent market gains.

The change in rating to ""Neutral"" suggests that Daiwa Securities sees limited upside for new investors at the current share price, despite the company's strong fundamentals. This stance indicates a shift in expectation for the stock's short-term performance.

By Jonathan Stempel

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett left no doubt: He misses Charlie Munger, and so will Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: )'s shareholders.

Buffett on Saturday devoted a special section of his annual shareholder letter to Munger, who died in November at age 99.

The 93-year-old Buffett called his long-time business partner a key driver behind what has become his more than $900 billion, Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.

""Charlie was the 'architect' of the present Berkshire, and I acted as the 'general contractor' to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision,"" Buffett wrote.

Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers Berkshire, called that a ""profound compliment"" from arguably the world's most revered investor.

""Buffett gave Charlie Munger a lot of credit for Berkshire's success and his personal success,"" he said. ""Without his wisdom and guidance, Buffett wouldn't have been as successful as he has been.""

Munger's death deprived Buffett of his closest confidante of more than 60 years, the last 45 as a Berkshire vice chairman.

The two grew up at the same time in Omaha, though Buffett did not meet Munger until 1959.

Under their leadership, Berkshire became the owner of dozens of businesses such as Geico insurance and the BNSF railroad and holder of more than $350 billion in stocks led by Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Munger was known for his common-sense, witty and occasionally acerbic maxims.

""Envy is a really stupid sin,"" he said in 2003, ""because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at.""

But he also became known as the person who changed Buffett's attitude toward investing.

Buffett credited Munger with convincing him to buy ""wonderful companies at fair prices instead of fair companies at wonderful prices"" -- the latter of which Buffett has referred to as ""cigar butts"" because their businesses might still contain puffs of smoke.

Calling him Berkshire's ""architect"" alluded to Munger's passion for architecture, including designing buildings.

Buffett also recalled Munger's relative modesty, saying Munger was okay with letting him ""take the bows and receive the accolades"" while serving more as an older brother or loving father.

One place Munger shared the stage was at Berkshire's annual meeting, where he and Buffett would sit before tens of thousands of shareholders -- and millions more online -- fielding shareholder questions and often finishing each other's thoughts.

Munger's death means Buffett will likely share the stage at this year's May 4 annual meeting only with Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who is slated to eventually become chief executive, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain.

James Armstrong, who leads Henry H Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh and has owned Berkshire stock for more than 35 years, said Buffett's letter was an apt epitaph for Munger and what he meant to Berkshire.

""Charlie's impact was huge,"" he said. ""It may not have been understood by the public, but it is now."""

BRKa +0.47% Add to/Remove from Watchlist AAPL -1.00% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) revealed on Wednesday that it has trimmed its significant stake in Apple (AAPL).

The firm revealed in a filing that it sold 10 million Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) in the fourth quarter. However, it still owns more than 905 million shares.

Apple shares are down around 1% Thursday following the news, adding to its recent pullback. The stock has fallen 3.5% in the last three months as investors have worried about iPhone demand.

While Berkshire's decision to reduce its Apple stake has fueled further concerns about the iPhone maker's shares, analysts believe Buffett still considers the tech giant to be a core holding.

A senior analyst at EdwardJones told Investing.com that context is helpful when assessing the situation.

The analyst explained that BRK held over 915 million AAPL shares from June 30, 2022, through September 30, 2023. Meanwhile, as of the end of 2023, BRK owned 905.6 million AAPL shares (5.8% of outstanding shares).

""Relative to September 30, BRK's holdings declined by 10.0 million shares or 1.1%. I do not view this reduction to be significant,"" the analyst said. ""BRK has trimmed AAPL holdings in the past.""

""AAPL represents about half of BRK's equity portfolio (excl. equity method investments KHC & OXY). While BRK could trim this position further, I believe that Mr. Buffett considers AAPL to be a core holding,"" it was added.

Furthermore, a note from Bernstein in September 2023 told investors to ""Be like Buffett,"" acknowledging that the legendary investor buys Apple shares on dips/closer to 20x earnings."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch higher, pointing to a continued recovery on Wall Street from a decline posted earlier this week. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: ) lowers its annual guidance and outlines plans to slash headcount, as executives at the network equipment manufacturer warn of weak future demand. Elsewhere, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) cuts its stake in tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ).

1. Futures edge up

U.S. stock futures gained on Thursday, after equities rebounded in the prior session from a dip earlier in the week.

By 04:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract had gained 11 points or 0.2%, had added 35 points or 0.2%, and had risen by 82 points or 0.2%.

The main indices on Wall Street gained on Wednesday, partially recovering from a drop on Tuesday sparked by hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation figures that led markets to push back their bets for the timing of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The benchmark rose by 1.0%, the tech-heavy advanced by 1.3%, and the blue-chip climbed by 0.4%.

Artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) jumped ahead of its much-anticipated quarterly results next week, surpassing Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) as the U.S. stock market's third-most valuable company. Ride-hailing group Lyft (NASDAQ: ) also surged by more than 30% thanks to a bullish annual free cash flow outlook and better-than-projected profit, while rival Uber (NYSE: ) soared on a new $7 billion share buyback plan.

2. Cisco Systems slashes guidance, unveils plans to cut workforce

Cisco Systems reduced its full-year guidance and detailed plans to cut its global workforce as part of a broader restructuring push, sending shares lower in premarket U.S. trading on Thursday.

The network equipment maker said it expects to post full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.68 to $3.74 on revenue between $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion, compared with a prior estimate for adjusted EPS of $3.87 to $3.93 and revenue of $53.8 billion to $55.0 billion. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Charles Robbins flagged that the business expects to see ""weak demand with our telco and cable service provider customers.""

Cisco added that it would slash headcount by about 5%. It said the move will result in an $800 million charge from severance and other one-time termination benefits and other costs. The bulk of these expenses are expected recognized in the first half of its 2025 fiscal year.

Highlighting the earnings calendar on Thursday will be results from agricultural equipment firm Deere & Company (NYSE: ), sports betting service DraftKings (NASDAQ: ) and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ).

3. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway trims Apple stake

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway lowered its position in tech giant Apple in the fourth quarter.

According to a securities filing on Wednesday, Berkshire offloaded 10 million shares in the iPhone maker, or about 1.1% of its stake in the firm.

Apple still remains crucial for Berkshire, the massive investment conglomerate that has an interest in swathe of major corporations across multiple industries. Following the sale, Berkshire, which first invested in Apple in 2016, had holdings in the group worth $174B at the end of last year -- well ahead of its second-biggest investment in lender Bank of America.

Speaking at Nebraska-based Berkshire's annual meeting in 2023, Buffett lauded Apple -- whose stock price has skyrocketed by more than 330% over the past five years -- as ""a better business than any we own.""

But Apple has recently lagged behind its peers in Big Tech as worries mount around its operations in China and regulatory scrutiny of its App Store. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company earlier this year.

4. TSMC shares jump after Morgan Stanley lifts Nvidia price target

Shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TW: ) touched a fresh record high on Thursday after analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target of client Nvidia.

TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is a key supplier for tech titans like Nvidia and Apple. The spike in shares in TSMC, which restarted trading following the Lunar New Year holiday, spurring on a broader rally in tech stocks in Asia.

Underpinning the increase was a note from analysts at Morgan Stanley in which they bumped up their price target for Nvidia to $750 from $603, citing booming demand for nascent AI technology. Nvidia manufactures the powerful graphics processing units needed to power large language models like the popular ChatGPT chatbot, making the California-based group one of the focal points of soaring enthusiasm around AI.

5. Oil subdued

Oil prices hovered around the flatline in early European trade on Thursday, as traders digested a substantially bigger-than-expected build in U.S. inventories and Japanese quarterly growth figures.

expiring in April were mostly unchanged at $81.59 a barrel, while were down 0.1% at $76.29 per barrel by 04:30 ET.

Crude prices had lost over $1 each on Wednesday after data showed U.S. oil inventories grew a staggering 12 million barrels in the week to February 9, much higher than expectations for a build of 3.3 million barrels. The reading was driven chiefly by record-high U.S. production, indicating that the world’s largest fuel consumer remained well-supplied with oil.

Meanwhile, gross domestic product (GDP) data from Japan showed the country unexpectedly entered a technical recession in the fourth quarter due in part to persistent weakness in private consumption."

(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway on Wednesday said it has trimmed its huge stake in Apple and shed four common stock holdings, and kept investors guessing on what could be a major new investment by Warren Buffett.

In a regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed stock holdings at the end of 2023, Berkshire said it sold 10 million Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) in the fourth quarter, but still owned more than 905 million shares worth about $174 billion.

Though Buffett has been driving Berkshire's investment in Apple, the stock sales in the iPhone maker could have been made by one of his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee some Berkshire investments.

Berkshire reported no holdings in homebuilder DR Horton (NYSE: ), insurer Globe Life (NYSE: ), insurance and investment company Markel (NYSE: ) and Brazilian credit card processor StoneCo, after holding more than $1 billion of those stocks at the end of September.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also boosted its stake in oil company Chevron (NYSE: ), one of its biggest holdings, and reduced its stakes in computer and printer maker HP (NYSE: ) and media company Paramount Global.

For a second straight quarter, Berkshire obtained permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to temporarily keep one or more of its holdings confidential.

It occasionally requests such treatment when it is making big investments, including multibillion-dollar stakes in Chevron, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), IBM (NYSE: ) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: ).

This is because investors often try to piggyback on what Berkshire does, reflecting Buffett's reputation as one of the world's greatest investors. Berkshire prefers not to have investors pile into its stocks before it's done buying.

In its third-quarter report in November, Berkshire hinted that its confidential investment may involve a bank, finance company or insurer because it had recently spent $1.2 billion on stock in that sector. It has yet to reveal where the money went.

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It no longer invests in Exxon, IBM and Verizon.

Buffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965.

The conglomerate also owns dozens of businesses including the Geico car insurer, BNSF railroad, energy and industrial companies, and consumer brands such as Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies.

It also owns the Pilot truck stop chain, after buying the 20% it didn't already own from the billionaire Haslam family in January.

Berkshire will reveal more about its investing and businesses when it releases its annual report and Buffett's annual letter to shareholders, expected on Feb. 24."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. fuel retailer Pilot Travel Centers said the president of its energy business and petroleum marketing chief have left the company in the latest shakeup after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) took majority control last year.

Brad Jenkins, who was president of Pilot Flying J Energy, and Bill Cashmareck, vice president of Petroleum Marketing and Business Development, are no longer with the company, it said in a statement.

The company last year replaced its chief executive and finance chief with longtime Berkshire executives and released about 15 employees, mostly tied to its trading operation.

Known for its Pilot Flying J truck stops, Knoxville, Tennessee-based Pilot had expanded a fuel purchase and trading business by recruiting experienced diesel, gasoline and crude oil traders from Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ), Phillips 66 (NYSE: ), Noble Group and others.

However, after Berkshire took an 80% stake, the company has been scaling down its risk-related trading operation, according to three people familiar with the matter."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by billionaire Warren Buffett, paid $2.6 billion last month for the 20% of the Pilot Travel Centers truck stop business it did not already own, after resolving a lawsuit over the price.

The price means Berkshire paid about $13.6 billion for Pilot, which operates more than 725 locations in the U.S. and Canada, and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.

Berkshire disclosed the purchase price in its annual report on Saturday.

Pilot, sometimes known as Pilot Flying J, had been founded in 1958 by Jim Haslam after he paid $6,000 for a Virginia gas station. It was later run by Jimmy Haslam, the billionaire owner of the Cleveland Browns football team.

Berkshire paid $2.76 billion in 2017 for 38.6% of Pilot and $8.2 billion for another 41.4% in January 2023, and subsequently overhauled its management.

Pilot, based in Knoxville, Tennessee, added $603 million to Berkshire's profit in 2023.

The Haslams had an annual 60-day window to sell their last 20% of Pilot, with the price based on its profits.

In competing lawsuits in Delaware Chancery Court, each side accused the other of manipulating Pilot's accounting in bad faith, with the Haslams saying Berkshire was undervaluing its stake, and Berkshire concerned it might overpay.

Buffett did not mention Pilot in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, also released on Saturday, but offered an anecdote about the risk of disappointment in acquisitions.

He recalled how Hugh McCulloch, the first comptroller of the United States, warned national banks in 1863 not to deal with a ""rascal"" even if they believed they could avoid being cheated.

""Many bankers who thought they could 'manage' the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch's advice--and I have as well,"" Buffett said. ""People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true now as it was in 1863.""

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Buffett said last May that he wished he could have bought all of Pilot in 2017, but the Haslams did not want to sell."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) on Saturday posted its second straight record annual operating profit, with its insurance business benefiting from improved underwriting and higher income from investments as interest rates rose.

Net income also reached a record $96.2 billion, as the rising stock market boosted the value of Berkshire's $354 billion equity portfolio, half of which is in Apple (NASDAQ: ).

In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said Berkshire's insurance businesses performed ""exceptionally well"" - among them, Geico, where better underwriting quality helped it more than reverse year-earlier losses.

This helped offset declining fourth-quarter and full-year profit at the BNSF railroad, where rising wages and costs for upkeep increased as revenue fell, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, beset by wildfire litigation and a tougher regulatory climate.

Buffett nevertheless assured investors that his approximately $903 billion conglomerate's ""extreme fiscal conservatism"" - including a now-record $167.6 billion cash stake - would serve them well.

Operating profit rose 28% to $8.48 billion, or about $5,884 per Class A share, in the fourth quarter, topping the average analyst forecast for $5,471 per share according to LSEG IBES.

For the year, operating profit rose 21% to $37.4 billion.

""Results reflect the value of holding a diversified collection of operating businesses,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.

He said Geico benefited from a willingness to cede market share by writing fewer risky policies, while also cutting advertising expenses.

The cash stake helped Berkshire's insurance businesses, which have $169 billion of so-called ""float,"" generate 38% more investment income in the quarter, as the Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates to curb inflation.

Results also included some of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: )'s earnings, from Berkshire's roughly 28% stake in the oil company.

Buffett said Berkshire plans to keep its stake indefinitely but has ""no interest"" in buying all of Occidental. Berkshire is also a big investor in oil company Chevron (NYSE: ).

""He is keeping a portfolio that is massively defensive and earning interest, and is buying oil stocks,"" said Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor who runs Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

'COSTLY MISTAKE'

Fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $37.57 billion, or $26,043 per Class A share, while the $96.2 billion annual profit topped the old record $89.9 billion from 2021.

Buffett considers net results misleading because they include gains and losses on investments that Berkshire has not sold.

Berkshire also spent about $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter repurchasing its own stock, and roughly $600 million more in the first six weeks of 2024.

But the cash stake grew in part because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks, selling $24.2 billion more than it bought in 2023.

It has been quietly building one or more holdings after obtaining U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval for confidentiality so that other investors will not copy Buffett while he is buying.

Some analysts have said those holdings could come from the bank, insurance and finance sector, where Berkshire invested about $3.6 billion in last year's second half.

Buffett said BNSF's margins have fallen behind those at its five major rivals since Berkshire bought the railroad in 2010, but that ""a century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of Berkshire. You can count on that.""

He also acknowledged making a ""costly mistake"" in not considering changes in the regulatory environment for utilities, including from climate change.

Buffett said it may also take years to know Berkshire's final bill from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has already racked up $2.4 billion of charges.

Berkshire's dozens of businesses also include industrial parts and chemical companies, a big real estate brokerage, and retail brands such as Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and See's candies.

Its stock has outperformed the market in 2024, rising 16% compared with the 's 7% gain, and set a record on Friday."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday moved to reassure investors that his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) would serve them well over the long term, even as he mourned the recent passing of his longtime second-in-command Charlie Munger.

In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders Buffett said his more than $900 billion conglomerate has become a fortress that could withstand even an unprecedented financial disaster.

""Berkshire is built to last,"" Buffett wrote.

Still, Buffett tempered expectations for Berkshire's stock price, saying his Omaha, Nebraska-based company ""should do a bit better"" than the average American corporation, but that its huge size left ""no possibility of eye-popping performance.""

""There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,"" Buffett wrote.

The letter was accompanied by Berkshire's financial results, including a record $37.4 billion operating profit and $96.2 billion net profit for all of 2023.

Berkshire's shares have risen by 4,384,748% since Buffett took over in 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually.

The , in contrast, gained a mere 31,223%, or 10.2% annually, though in recent years Berkshire has performed more like the index.

The 93-year-old Buffett assured investors that Vice Chairman and designated successor Greg Abel was ""in all respects ready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow.""

But the billionaire saved his most heartfelt words for Munger, who died in November at age 99.

Buffett called Munger the ""architect"" of Berkshire, with Buffett being only the ""general contractor,"" and reminded investors how Munger pushed him to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices instead of fair businesses at wonderful prices.

Berkshire's ""extreme fiscal conservatism,"" including a reluctance to pay inflated prices, is one reason Buffett let Berkshire's cash stake swell to a record $167.6 billion.

""In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father,"" Buffett wrote, referring to Munger. ""Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never--never--reminded me of my mistake.""

Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Buffett ""wouldn't have been as successful"" without Munger.

STICKING TO ITS KNITTING

Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" said Buffett tried to show Berkshire's ability to withstand rocky shoals, after transforming it from a failing textile company into a colossus mirroring the broader economy.

""Nothing is perfect,"" she said. ""He tried to show there is a succession plan, and Berkshire would stick to its knitting.""

Buffett likened Berkshire's caution, with the stock market now routinely setting record highs, to an insurance policy against hasty, ""dumb"" business decisions that would irk Munger.

Thomas Russo, a longtime shareholder at Gardner, Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said Buffett still offers shareholders ""tremendous value from his ability to make decisions before the opportunity is far gone.""

Berkshire said fourth-quarter operating profit from its dozens of insurance, railroad, industrial, energy, and retail businesses rose 28% to $8.48 billion. Full year profit rose 21%.

The Geico car insurer benefited in 2023 from improved underwriting and cost cuts, including the shedding of 7,700 jobs, or 20% of its workforce, while higher interest rates boosted investment income for Berkshire's insurance units.

That helped offset wage pressures at the BNSF railroad and wildfire losses at Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

""Berkshire has diversified, very solid assets,"" said James Armstrong, a longtime Berkshire investor at Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. ""A mom-and-pop investor can feel that Berkshire is unlikely to suffer permanent harm.""

Investment gains in Berkshire's $354 billion portfolio of stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Bank of America and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), helped generate Berkshire's $96.2 billion net profit.

That amount reflects accounting rules that require Berkshire to report gains in stocks it hasn't sold, however, making it ""worse-than-useless"" to investors according to Buffett.

MARKET EXCESS

Berkshire's caution, and a reason for its record cash stake, was reflected in its having sold about $24 billion more stocks than it bought in 2023.

""His letter is cautioning that other investors may be massively overpaying for stocks and businesses,"" said Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

Results also included some of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: )'s earnings, which reflected Berkshire's approximately 28% stake in the oil company.

Buffett said he expects Berkshire will keep that stake ""indefinitely,"" along with its stakes in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo.

Munger's death means only Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will share the stage with Buffett at Berkshire's annual meeting, where Buffett and Munger spent hours entertaining and answering questions from shareholders, with millions more watching online.

This year's meeting is scheduled for May 4 in Omaha.

Buffett's letter made no mention of portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who have been slated to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after he's gone.

Berkshire's businesses also include industrial parts and chemical companies, a big real estate brokerage, and retail brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's candies."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett left no doubt: He misses Charlie Munger, and so will Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: )'s shareholders.

Buffett on Saturday devoted a special section of his annual shareholder letter to Munger, who died in November at age 99.

The 93-year-old Buffett called his long-time business partner a key driver behind what has become his more than $900 billion, Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.

""Charlie was the 'architect' of the present Berkshire, and I acted as the 'general contractor' to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision,"" Buffett wrote.

Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers Berkshire, called that a ""profound compliment"" from arguably the world's most revered investor.

""Buffett gave Charlie Munger a lot of credit for Berkshire's success and his personal success,"" he said. ""Without his wisdom and guidance, Buffett wouldn't have been as successful as he has been.""

Munger's death deprived Buffett of his closest confidante of more than 60 years, the last 45 as a Berkshire vice chairman.

The two grew up at the same time in Omaha, though Buffett did not meet Munger until 1959.

Under their leadership, Berkshire became the owner of dozens of businesses such as Geico insurance and the BNSF railroad and holder of more than $350 billion in stocks led by Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Munger was known for his common-sense, witty and occasionally acerbic maxims.

""Envy is a really stupid sin,"" he said in 2003, ""because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at.""

But he also became known as the person who changed Buffett's attitude toward investing.

Buffett credited Munger with convincing him to buy ""wonderful companies at fair prices instead of fair companies at wonderful prices"" -- the latter of which Buffett has referred to as ""cigar butts"" because their businesses might still contain puffs of smoke.

Calling him Berkshire's ""architect"" alluded to Munger's passion for architecture, including designing buildings.

Buffett also recalled Munger's relative modesty, saying Munger was okay with letting him ""take the bows and receive the accolades"" while serving more as an older brother or loving father.

One place Munger shared the stage was at Berkshire's annual meeting, where he and Buffett would sit before tens of thousands of shareholders -- and millions more online -- fielding shareholder questions and often finishing each other's thoughts.

Munger's death means Buffett will likely share the stage at this year's May 4 annual meeting only with Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who is slated to eventually become chief executive, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain.

James Armstrong, who leads Henry H Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh and has owned Berkshire stock for more than 35 years, said Buffett's letter was an apt epitaph for Munger and what he meant to Berkshire.

""Charlie's impact was huge,"" he said. ""It may not have been understood by the public, but it is now."""

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) revealed on Wednesday that it has trimmed its significant stake in Apple (AAPL).

The firm revealed in a filing that it sold 10 million Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) in the fourth quarter. However, it still owns more than 905 million shares.

Apple shares are down around 1% Thursday following the news, adding to its recent pullback. The stock has fallen 3.5% in the last three months as investors have worried about iPhone demand.

While Berkshire's decision to reduce its Apple stake has fueled further concerns about the iPhone maker's shares, analysts believe Buffett still considers the tech giant to be a core holding.

A senior analyst at EdwardJones told Investing.com that context is helpful when assessing the situation.

The analyst explained that BRK held over 915 million AAPL shares from June 30, 2022, through September 30, 2023. Meanwhile, as of the end of 2023, BRK owned 905.6 million AAPL shares (5.8% of outstanding shares).

""Relative to September 30, BRK's holdings declined by 10.0 million shares or 1.1%. I do not view this reduction to be significant,"" the analyst said. ""BRK has trimmed AAPL holdings in the past.""

""AAPL represents about half of BRK's equity portfolio (excl. equity method investments KHC & OXY). While BRK could trim this position further, I believe that Mr. Buffett considers AAPL to be a core holding,"" it was added.

Furthermore, a note from Bernstein in September 2023 told investors to ""Be like Buffett,"" acknowledging that the legendary investor buys Apple shares on dips/closer to 20x earnings."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. fuel retailer Pilot Travel Centers said the president of its energy business and petroleum marketing chief have left the company in the latest shakeup after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) took majority control last year.

Brad Jenkins, who was president of Pilot Flying J Energy, and Bill Cashmareck, vice president of Petroleum Marketing and Business Development, are no longer with the company, it said in a statement.

The company last year replaced its chief executive and finance chief with longtime Berkshire executives and released about 15 employees, mostly tied to its trading operation.

Known for its Pilot Flying J truck stops, Knoxville, Tennessee-based Pilot had expanded a fuel purchase and trading business by recruiting experienced diesel, gasoline and crude oil traders from Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ), Phillips 66 (NYSE: ), Noble Group and others.

However, after Berkshire took an 80% stake, the company has been scaling down its risk-related trading operation, according to three people familiar with the matter."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by billionaire Warren Buffett, paid $2.6 billion last month for the 20% of the Pilot Travel Centers truck stop business it did not already own, after resolving a lawsuit over the price.

The price means Berkshire paid about $13.6 billion for Pilot, which operates more than 725 locations in the U.S. and Canada, and sold 13 billion gallons of fuel in 2022.

Berkshire disclosed the purchase price in its annual report on Saturday.

Pilot, sometimes known as Pilot Flying J, had been founded in 1958 by Jim Haslam after he paid $6,000 for a Virginia gas station. It was later run by Jimmy Haslam, the billionaire owner of the Cleveland Browns football team.

Berkshire paid $2.76 billion in 2017 for 38.6% of Pilot and $8.2 billion for another 41.4% in January 2023, and subsequently overhauled its management.

Pilot, based in Knoxville, Tennessee, added $603 million to Berkshire's profit in 2023.

The Haslams had an annual 60-day window to sell their last 20% of Pilot, with the price based on its profits.

In competing lawsuits in Delaware Chancery Court, each side accused the other of manipulating Pilot's accounting in bad faith, with the Haslams saying Berkshire was undervaluing its stake, and Berkshire concerned it might overpay.

Buffett did not mention Pilot in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, also released on Saturday, but offered an anecdote about the risk of disappointment in acquisitions.

He recalled how Hugh McCulloch, the first comptroller of the United States, warned national banks in 1863 not to deal with a ""rascal"" even if they believed they could avoid being cheated.

""Many bankers who thought they could 'manage' the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch's advice--and I have as well,"" Buffett said. ""People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true now as it was in 1863.""

Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Buffett said last May that he wished he could have bought all of Pilot in 2017, but the Haslams did not want to sell."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) on Saturday posted its second straight record annual operating profit, with its insurance business benefiting from improved underwriting and higher income from investments as interest rates rose.

Net income also reached a record $96.2 billion, as the rising stock market boosted the value of Berkshire's $354 billion equity portfolio, half of which is in Apple (NASDAQ: ).

In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said Berkshire's insurance businesses performed ""exceptionally well"" - among them, Geico, where better underwriting quality helped it more than reverse year-earlier losses.

This helped offset declining fourth-quarter and full-year profit at the BNSF railroad, where rising wages and costs for upkeep increased as revenue fell, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, beset by wildfire litigation and a tougher regulatory climate.

Buffett nevertheless assured investors that his approximately $903 billion conglomerate's ""extreme fiscal conservatism"" - including a now-record $167.6 billion cash stake - would serve them well.

Operating profit rose 28% to $8.48 billion, or about $5,884 per Class A share, in the fourth quarter, topping the average analyst forecast for $5,471 per share according to LSEG IBES.

For the year, operating profit rose 21% to $37.4 billion.

""Results reflect the value of holding a diversified collection of operating businesses,"" said Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan.

He said Geico benefited from a willingness to cede market share by writing fewer risky policies, while also cutting advertising expenses.

The cash stake helped Berkshire's insurance businesses, which have $169 billion of so-called ""float,"" generate 38% more investment income in the quarter, as the Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates to curb inflation.

Results also included some of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: )'s earnings, from Berkshire's roughly 28% stake in the oil company.

Buffett said Berkshire plans to keep its stake indefinitely but has ""no interest"" in buying all of Occidental. Berkshire is also a big investor in oil company Chevron (NYSE: ).

""He is keeping a portfolio that is massively defensive and earning interest, and is buying oil stocks,"" said Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor who runs Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

'COSTLY MISTAKE'

Fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $37.57 billion, or $26,043 per Class A share, while the $96.2 billion annual profit topped the old record $89.9 billion from 2021.

Buffett considers net results misleading because they include gains and losses on investments that Berkshire has not sold.

Berkshire also spent about $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter repurchasing its own stock, and roughly $600 million more in the first six weeks of 2024.

But the cash stake grew in part because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks, selling $24.2 billion more than it bought in 2023.

It has been quietly building one or more holdings after obtaining U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval for confidentiality so that other investors will not copy Buffett while he is buying.

Some analysts have said those holdings could come from the bank, insurance and finance sector, where Berkshire invested about $3.6 billion in last year's second half.

Buffett said BNSF's margins have fallen behind those at its five major rivals since Berkshire bought the railroad in 2010, but that ""a century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of Berkshire. You can count on that.""

He also acknowledged making a ""costly mistake"" in not considering changes in the regulatory environment for utilities, including from climate change.

Buffett said it may also take years to know Berkshire's final bill from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has already racked up $2.4 billion of charges.

Berkshire's dozens of businesses also include industrial parts and chemical companies, a big real estate brokerage, and retail brands such as Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear and See's candies.

Its stock has outperformed the market in 2024, rising 16% compared with the 's 7% gain, and set a record on Friday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is taking on Build-A-Bear.

Jazwares, the Berkshire Hathaway-owned maker of the popular Squishmallows plush toys, sued Build-A-Bear Workshop on Monday, calling its new Skoosherz plush toy line ""knockoffs"" that infringed its intellectual property rights.

Not to be outdone, Build-A-Bear filed its own lawsuit against Jazwares on Monday, saying Skoosherz are based on its existing plush animals, and that its advertising and marketing since last month's launch make clear who made them.

The dispute marks Jazwares' latest effort to protect Squishmallows from alleged knockoffs and counterfeits, including a lawsuit against online retail platform Alibaba (NYSE: ).

Squishmallows joined the ranks of the world's hottest toys after becoming a viral sensation on TikTok, and winning devotees like Lady Gaga and Kim Kardashian.

They have been a part of Berkshire since Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate bought Jazwares' parent, the insurance holding company Alleghany (NYSE: ), in October 2022.

Jazwares sued Build-A-Bear in Los Angeles federal court.

It said Build-A-Bear ""blatantly and intentionally"" undermined its goodwill and created substantial confusion among consumers by copying Squishmallows' look and feel, including ""shaped fanciful renditions"" of animals, ""simplified Asian style Kawaii faces,"" and ""velvety velour-like"" fabric.

""When it comes to intellectual property rights, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery,"" Jazwares' lawyer, Moez Kaba, said in a statement.

According to Build-A-Bear's lawsuit in St. Louis federal court, however, Squishmallows lack a consistent look and feel, and Skoosherz are simply the most recent type of ""soft, pillow-like squishie-type"" toys that have been trending for years.

Build-A-Bear said it launched Skoosherz in anticipation of Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, to tap a market for plush toys that were ""uniquely styled for optimal hugging benefits.""

Neither Build-A-Bear nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for additional comment.

Jazwares wants Build-A-Bear to stop selling Skoosherz and similar products, and pay unspecified triple damages.

Build-A-Bear wants a court declaration that it did not infringe Jazwares' ""trade dress"" rights in Squishmallows, and that any such rights are unenforceable.

Squishmallows were created in 2016 by Kelly Toys. Jazwares bought a majority stake in that company four years later.

The cases are is Kelly Toys Holdings LLC et al v Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc (NYSE: ), U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 24-01169; and Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc v Kelly Toys Holdings LLC et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, No. 24-00211."

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday moved to reassure investors that his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) would serve them well over the long term, even as he mourned the recent passing of his longtime second-in-command Charlie Munger.

In his widely-read annual letter to Berkshire shareholders Buffett said his more than $900 billion conglomerate has become a fortress that could withstand even an unprecedented financial disaster.

""Berkshire is built to last,"" Buffett wrote.

Still, Buffett tempered expectations for Berkshire's stock price, saying his Omaha, Nebraska-based company ""should do a bit better"" than the average American corporation, but that its huge size left ""no possibility of eye-popping performance.""

""There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,"" Buffett wrote.

The letter was accompanied by Berkshire's financial results, including a record $37.4 billion operating profit and $96.2 billion net profit for all of 2023.

Berkshire's shares have risen by 4,384,748% since Buffett took over in 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually.

The , in contrast, gained a mere 31,223%, or 10.2% annually, though in recent years Berkshire has performed more like the index.

The 93-year-old Buffett assured investors that Vice Chairman and designated successor Greg Abel was ""in all respects ready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow.""

But the billionaire saved his most heartfelt words for Munger, who died in November at age 99.

Buffett called Munger the ""architect"" of Berkshire, with Buffett being only the ""general contractor,"" and reminded investors how Munger pushed him to buy wonderful businesses at fair prices instead of fair businesses at wonderful prices.

Berkshire's ""extreme fiscal conservatism,"" including a reluctance to pay inflated prices, is one reason Buffett let Berkshire's cash stake swell to a record $167.6 billion.

""In a way his relationship with me was part older brother, part loving father,"" Buffett wrote, referring to Munger. ""Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the reins, and when I blundered he never--never--reminded me of my mistake.""

Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said Buffett ""wouldn't have been as successful"" without Munger.

STICKING TO ITS KNITTING

Cathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" said Buffett tried to show Berkshire's ability to withstand rocky shoals, after transforming it from a failing textile company into a colossus mirroring the broader economy.

""Nothing is perfect,"" she said. ""He tried to show there is a succession plan, and Berkshire would stick to its knitting.""

Buffett likened Berkshire's caution, with the stock market now routinely setting record highs, to an insurance policy against hasty, ""dumb"" business decisions that would irk Munger.

Thomas Russo, a longtime shareholder at Gardner, Russo & Quinn in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, said Buffett still offers shareholders ""tremendous value from his ability to make decisions before the opportunity is far gone.""

Berkshire said fourth-quarter operating profit from its dozens of insurance, railroad, industrial, energy, and retail businesses rose 28% to $8.48 billion. Full year profit rose 21%.

The Geico car insurer benefited in 2023 from improved underwriting and cost cuts, including the shedding of 7,700 jobs, or 20% of its workforce, while higher interest rates boosted investment income for Berkshire's insurance units.

That helped offset wage pressures at the BNSF railroad and wildfire losses at Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

""Berkshire has diversified, very solid assets,"" said James Armstrong, a longtime Berkshire investor at Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh. ""A mom-and-pop investor can feel that Berkshire is unlikely to suffer permanent harm.""

Investment gains in Berkshire's $354 billion portfolio of stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Bank of America and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), helped generate Berkshire's $96.2 billion net profit.

That amount reflects accounting rules that require Berkshire to report gains in stocks it hasn't sold, however, making it ""worse-than-useless"" to investors according to Buffett.

MARKET EXCESS

Berkshire's caution, and a reason for its record cash stake, was reflected in its having sold about $24 billion more stocks than it bought in 2023.

""His letter is cautioning that other investors may be massively overpaying for stocks and businesses,"" said Bill Smead, a longtime Berkshire investor at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

Results also included some of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: )'s earnings, which reflected Berkshire's approximately 28% stake in the oil company.

Buffett said he expects Berkshire will keep that stake ""indefinitely,"" along with its stakes in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo.

Munger's death means only Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will share the stage with Buffett at Berkshire's annual meeting, where Buffett and Munger spent hours entertaining and answering questions from shareholders, with millions more watching online.

This year's meeting is scheduled for May 4 in Omaha.

Buffett's letter made no mention of portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who have been slated to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after he's gone.

Berkshire's businesses also include industrial parts and chemical companies, a big real estate brokerage, and retail brands such as Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's candies."

SQ +16.13% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Friday, Wells Fargo upgraded Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ) from Equal Weight to Overweight, significantly raising the price target to $95 from the previous $65. The adjustment reflects a positive outlook on the company's financial prospects, with the new target based on a valuation of 6 times the forecasted fiscal year 2025 gross profit of $10.3 billion.

Wells Fargo's analysis suggests that the enterprise value to gross profit (EV/Gross Profit) ratio is a critical measure for valuing companies within the financial technology sector. Gross profit is highlighted as a crucial indicator due to its ability to demonstrate unit economics and contribution margins, which are essential for assessing long-term operating leverage.

The optimism surrounding Block Inc. is tempered by potential downside risks identified by Wells Fargo. These concerns include the possibility of seller gross payment volume (GPV) trends deteriorating due to heightened competition or a recession in the U.S. that could negatively impact transaction volumes. Another risk factor is the potential for margins to suffer if cost management initiatives led by the company's management adversely affect revenue growth.

Despite these risks, the upgrade indicates a confidence in Block's ability to navigate the competitive landscape and maintain healthy margins, which is a positive sign for investors. The new price target represents a substantial increase from the previous estimate, suggesting that Wells Fargo sees a stronger value proposition in Block's shares.

Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring Block Inc.'s performance to see if the company can meet the expectations set by Wells Fargo's revised analysis. The upgrade and new price target are likely to influence the market's view of Block's stock in the near term.

InvestingPro Insights

Following the upgrade by Wells Fargo, Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ) has shown a strong return over the last three months, with data indicating a 15.15% price total return in that period. This performance underscores Wells Fargo's confidence and aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Block is a prominent player in the Financial Services industry, which could be a contributing factor to its robust market presence and recent stock resilience.

InvestingPro Data reveals a market capitalization of $41.83 billion, reflecting the company's significant scale within the sector. Despite not being profitable over the last twelve months, as indicated by an adjusted P/E ratio of -121.25, analysts predict, as per another InvestingPro Tip, that the company will be profitable this year. This forward-looking optimism might be factored into Wells Fargo's positive reassessment.

Moreover, Block's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, providing it with a solid liquidity position to navigate potential market fluctuations. This financial stability could be a key component in the company's ability to sustain operations and pursue growth despite not currently paying a dividend to shareholders.

SQ +16.13% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Friday, Seaport Global Securities revised their rating on Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ), lifting the stock from Neutral to Buy, and established a new price target of $95.00. The upgrade follows Block's recent organizational improvements and financial performance, which have exceeded expectations.

The company, known for its Square and Cash App services, has been commended for its organizational streamlining and focus on driving profitable growth. Block's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached a record $562 million, surpassing analyst and street predictions by 25%. The adjusted EBITDA margin also saw a significant increase of 1100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.

Seaport Global Securities anticipates further operating leverage for Block, as the company maintains its employee count under the 12,000 cap. The growth in gross profit for both Square and Cash App is expected to contribute to this leverage. Additionally, Block's guidance for 2024's adjusted EBITDA of $2.63 billion suggests a year-over-year growth of over 45%, with potential for further growth.

The firm's analysts have adjusted their forecasts for Block's adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and 2025 upwards. They believe that Block is on track to meet its Rule of 40 framework by 2026. The price target of $95 is based on a 16x multiple of the company's projected 2025 enterprise value to EBITDA. The assessment concludes that the risk/reward balance for Block's shares is reasonable, with potential for additional upside.

SQ +16.13% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Block Inc (NYSE: ) hiked its guidance for the full fiscal 2024 on Thursday, sending its shares rising significantly in after-hours. Block stock continued attracting investor attention in Friday’s premarket and was up over 16% at the time of writing.

Block’s Q4 earnings

Jack Dorsey’s Block exceeded expectations in its fiscal Q4 report, driven by strong performance and increased monetization of its Cash App payment application.

The an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.45 on revenue of $5.77 billion, surpassing the anticipated adjusted EPS of $0.67 on revenue of $5.71 billion.

Cash App was a significant contributor, generating $3.91 billion in revenue and $1.18 billion in gross profit, marking year-over-year increases of 31% and 25%, respectively.

The app's monetization rate improved to 1.48%, showing growth both on an annualized and sequential basis.

However, the highlight of the report was the upward revision of its full-year guidance for 2024.

The financial technology firm now forecasts an adjusted operating income of at least $1.15 billion, indicating a 13% margin, and an adjusted EBITDA of at least $2.63 billion, reflecting a 30% margin.

This represents a marked increase from the previous projections of $875 million for adjusted operating income and $2.4 billion for adjusted EBITDA.

For the first quarter, Block projects an adjusted operating income between $225 million and $245 million, and an adjusted EBITDA ranging from $570 million to $590 million.

Block stock forecast

In the aftermath of the report, Seaport’s senior analyst Jeff Cantwell upgraded Block stock to Buy from Neutral.

“SQ's progress over the past several months in terms of streamlining itself organizationally, sharpening its focus within its two key businesses Square and Cash App, and becoming hyper-focused on driving profitable growth has been impressive - and we think there's more to go,” the analyst wrote in a note.

Moreover, Seaport also raised its guidance for the company’s adjusted EBITDA for 2024 and 2025, while retaining the price target of $95. That implies an upside potential of nearly 40% from Block stock’s latest closing price.

Meanwhile, Wolfe Research analysts raised their target price on SQ to $95 from $85, anticipating additional growth potential, especially in the latter half of the year.

The broker expects Cash App's monthly active users (MAUs) to increase by about 1 million each quarter.

“We see upside to #'s particularly in 2H (primarily from Cash App) due to higher inflow/active and adoption of Direct Deposit, uptake of new product and features, and faster integration and scaling of Commerce,” analysts led by Darrin Peller noted.

Morgan Stanley analysts also gave a vote of confidence to Block stock, lifting the target price to $62 from $55.

The Wall Street giant SQ has a prime opportunity to leverage demographic trends to grow its financial services through Cash App, supported by the profitability of its Seller business.

However, they caution that the company’s potential could be at risk if it fails to accelerate growth in both the Square business and Cash App, especially if it cannot expand credit and banking services while operational expenses are decreasing."

(Reuters) -Shares of Jack Dorsey-led Block jumped nearly 20% in early trading on Friday following premarket gains as cost cuts helped the payments firm forecast first-quarter core earnings above Wall Street expectations.

The stock was trading at $81.39, adding more than $8 billion to the company's market value.

Block has been looking to lower costs and drive ""profitable growth"" in the business by trimming headcount and reducing its real estate footprint. The company said on Thursday it plans to cut 112 jobs in March.

Investing.com-- The Dow and S&P 500 notched a record close Friday, even as the rally in Nvidia cooled to blunt the broader tech sector's swashbuckling gains amid waning optimism for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.

By 16:00 ET (21:40 GMT), the closed 62 points, or 0.2%, eked out gains to close at a fresh record of 5,088.85, while fell 0.3%. The three major averages closed up for the week, rising more than 1%.

Nvidia briefly joins $2 trillion club as climb continues

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) gave up the bulk of its gains to close just above the flatline after briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time, having added $277 billion in stock market value the previous day, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings saw investors largely trade past warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates will stay higher for longer- a notion that was further reinforced by stronger-than-expected jobless claims data.

The gains in Nvidia helped keep losses in the broader semiconductor index in check after Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: ) gave up some gains from a day earlier.

Fed speak continues to weigh on rate-cut bets

Investors continued to rein in their expectations for aggressive rate cuts, following fresh remarks from Federal Reserve officials that point to a prolonged higher-for-longer interest-rate regime.

Federal Reserve Board Governor said on Thursday that he was in ""no rush"" to lower rates. A slew of Fed members have previously echoed this notion, citing fears of sticky inflation and strength in the labor market.

Traders are now expecting the first rate cut in June rather than May, with just four rate cuts expected, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that they no longer think the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to slash interest rates at its policy meeting in May following Waller's comments, now expecting the Fed to roll out its first 25 basis-point cut in June.

Warner Bros Discovery slumps after quarterly loss; Carvana , Block shine on earnings stage

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped more than 9% after the media giant reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Friday, as the media conglomerate battled a weak advertising market and the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.

Carvana (NYSE: ) jumped 31% after the used car company narrowed quarterly losses and forecast core earnings well above $100 million in the first quarter,

The company ""continues to show outsized GPU improvement and is giving bulls hope of being on the doorstep of a bigger return to volume growth,"" RBC said in a note as it upgraded its price target on the company to $45 from $24.

Payments firm Block (NYSE: ) gained 16% after it beat quarterly revenue estimates and hiked its annual operating profit outlook, driven by strong performance in its Cash App as margins improved.

Block ""sharpening its focus within its two key businesses Square and Cash App, and becoming hyper-focused on driving profitable growth has been impressive - and we think there's more to go,"" Seaport said Friday after upgrading its rating on the stock to buy from neutral.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, fell 12% to add to its losses from a day earlier after UBS slapped a sell rating on the stock, marking a double downgrade form a buy on worries of waning EV demand.

""A changing EV backdrop causes us to reassess our demand view and makes RIVN’s current strategy quite onerous on the ramp to profitability and cash flow,"" UBS said in a note.

Investing.com -- Main U.S. indexes consolidated Friday, trading in tight ranges after the previous session’s dramatic Nvidia’s inspired rally.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:​

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock rose as much as 4.9% with the artificial intelligence chip designer continuing to see demand after adding a staggering $277 billion in market capitalization on Thursday, setting a record for the biggest one-day jump in history. Shares reversed course midday, falling about 1%.

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 12% after the media giant reported fourth-quarter revenue that was below average forecasts, but said it is now on a ""clear pathway"" to growth.

Carvana (CVNA) stock soared 33% after the used car company forecast core earnings well above $100 million in the first quarter.

Block (SQ) stock rose 16% after the payments firm beat quarterly revenue estimates and hiked its annual operating profit outlook.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 11%, continuing the previous session’s sharp drop after UBS downgraded its investment stance on the electric truck maker all the way to ‘sell’ from ‘buy’, citing a ""rapidly changing EV backdrop.""

DraftKings (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 2.9% after Barclays upgraded the betting company to ‘overweight’ from ‘equal weight’, recognizing the significant growth potential in the U.S. digital gaming market.

SQ +16.13% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Friday, Block Inc. (NYSE:SQ), a financial technology company, received a positive outlook from Citi, with an increase in the price target for its shares. The new price target is set at $86.00, up from the previous $76.00, while the firm continues to recommend a Buy rating for the stock.

The adjustment follows Block's fourth-quarter performance, which showcased effective restructuring efforts leading to a 25% EBITDA beat. This outperformance also prompted a 10% lift in the company's outlook. Additionally, Block's Square Gross Payment Volume (GPV) met expectations, supported by a notable beat in the Subscription and Services (S&S) segment.

Block's CashApp also demonstrated strong growth, with increased card penetration, reacceleration of inflows, and enhanced monetization. Momentum is building for CashApp Pay, aligning with the company's ambitious product plans. The cited products, ""Borrow,"" ""Commerce,"" and the newly introduced ""Yield,"" are progressing well and are expected to bridge the gap between Block's offerings and traditional banking services, including bill payment which is anticipated to drive retention and engagement.

Citi's revised outlook also reflects an appreciation for CashApp's strategic shift back to focusing on the U.S. market. Prior to the results, there was an anticipation that it might take one to two quarters for Block to take a more aggressive stance due to restructuring. However, the recent developments suggest that there is now a solid basis for improved investor sentiment and potential for the stock's valuation to align more closely with its growth-adjusted multiple.

Citi's increased conviction in Block Inc. and the 13% raise in the target price is based on higher estimates and the belief that the stock is poised to trade at a multiple that better reflects its growth prospects. The firm's endorsement of a Buy rating on NYSE:SQ remains unchanged.

She will report to Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun and serve on the company's Executive Council.

""Uma is a superb leader with a strong track record of building terrific teams and strengthening complex organizations. Continuing to invest in our 170,000 employees around the world will be a priority as their actions, voices and ideas make it possible for us to bolster our quality and earn confidence with key stakeholders,"" said Calhoun.

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing said on Wednesday it was replacing the head of its troubled 737 MAX program effective immediately, the first major executive departure since the Jan. 5 mid-air panel blowout of a new Alaska Airlines MAX 9.

Ed Clark, who had been with the planemaker for nearly 18 years, departed as Boeing (NYSE: ) has been dealing with its latest crisis and has vowed to bolster quality efforts.

Katie Ringgold is replacing him as vice president and general manager of the 737 program, according to a memo seen by Reuters sent to staff by Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal. The memo also listed other management changes including creation of a senior vice president position for quality and safety.

The planemaker's production has been curbed by regulators and closely scrutinized by lawmakers and customers. Deal's memo announcing the change said Boeing was working to ensure ""that every airplane we deliver meets or exceeds all quality and safety requirements.""

Boeing has scrambled to explain and strengthen safety procedures after a door panel detached during flight on a brand new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9, forcing pilots to make an emergency landing while passengers were exposed to a gaping hole 16,000 feet above the ground.

Boeing's board met this week and approved the management changes, according to sources familiar with the matter. Clark oversaw the production facility in Renton, Washington, where the plane involved in the accident was completed.

Previously chief mechanic and engineer for the 737, he was named head of the program in 2021, the fifth person in four years to run it.

Boeing said Elizabeth Lund was named to the new position of senior vice president for Boeing Commercial Airlines Quality leading quality control and quality assurance efforts. Mike Fleming will succeed her as senior vice president and general manager, airplane programs. He will also continue leading Boeing's customer support team.

The latest mishap is Boeing's second major crisis in recent years, after crashes in 2018 and 2019 of MAX planes killed 346 people. That prompted a grounding of the 737 MAX for 20 months and Boeing was still working to rebuild its reputation.

Airline industry executives have expressed frustration with Boeing's quality control. France's Airbus (PA: ), the only other major manufacturer of commercial jets, last month reported record annual jet orders and confirmed an 11% rise in 2023 deliveries, maintaining the top manufacturing spot against Boeing for a fifth year.

""Firing the head of the MAX program was likely a matter of time, but I don’t think it means very much,"" said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of aerospace consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory and a Boeing critic. “The company’s problems are cultural, with the tone being set from the top.”

The memo was first reported by the Seattle Times.

David Nolletti, New York-based head of the aerospace practice at business services consultancy Riveron, said the change would affect how the program is managed and could signal more changes.

“It’s not just a figurehead position,” Nolletti said.

“I think we’ll see more changes at Boeing as they evaluate their position and how their programs are performing.”

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun plans to meet with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief Mike Whitaker next week after the U.S. aviation regulator traveled to Renton to tour the Boeing 737 plant.

The FAA said Whitaker ""will discuss what he observed during his visit to Boeing with the company’s executives when they come to Washington to discuss"" quality control and other issues.

Boeing shares closed down 0.8% on Wednesday.

PRODUCTION DELAYS

The FAA grounded the MAX 9 for several weeks in January and has capped Boeing's production of the MAX while it audits the manufacturing process after a string of quality issues.

Boeing on Jan. 30 withdrew a request for a key safety exemption for its MAX 7 jet, which could push approval out until at least 2025.

The door panel that flew off the MAX 9 appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report this month from the U.S. National Safety Transportation Board. The panel is a plug in place on some 737 MAX 9s instead of an additional emergency exit.

According to the report, the door plug in question was removed to repair rivet damage, but the NTSB has not found evidence the bolts were re-installed.

The disclosure angered Boeing's airline customers. Some including Alaska Airlines announced they would conduct enhanced quality oversight of planes before they leave the Boeing factory."
Boeing,Northcoast cuts Boeing to neutral amid earnings concerns,2024-02-23,08:57,AM,"Published Feb 23, 2024 08:57AM ET

On Friday, Northcoast Research adjusted its stance on Boeing Company (NYSE: ), moving its rating from Buy to Neutral. The firm cited several reasons for the downgrade, including concerns over earnings visibility and the absence of clear market catalysts. Additionally, Northcoast Research pointed out new issues with some long-term growth drivers for Boeing.

The downgrade comes as Northcoast Research expresses apprehension regarding Boeing's near-term financial performance. The firm's proprietary checks and recent news have contributed to a minimal level of confidence in the aircraft manufacturer's revised estimates. They also raised questions about how much of the potential negative news may have already been factored into Boeing's current stock price.

According to Northcoast Research, investors might anticipate a six to nine-month delay in Boeing's earnings recovery. This expected delay could result in Boeing's shares being stuck in what the firm describes as a ""low-altitude holding pattern"" for an extended period.

The challenges facing Boeing, as outlined by Northcoast Research, include instability in commercial aircraft production, the potential for further loss of market share, delays in the introduction and certification of new products, and reduced credibility of Boeing's management. Given these issues, Northcoast Research suggests that alternative aerospace investments, particularly those tied to aftermarket demand or wide-body aircraft production, may be more attractive to investors at this time.

By Xinghui Kok, Lisa Barrington and Brenda Goh

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Parts shortages and delivery delays plaguing the global aviation industry are easing, but could take up to two years to resolve, firms at the Singapore Airshow said, adding to the pressures clouding a post-pandemic recovery in travel demand.

European planemaker Airbus said it was sending ""dozens and dozens"" of engineers deep into supply chains to unlock bottlenecks, and aircraft maintenance firms such as Lufthansa Technik said they were stocking more spare parts to mitigate delays. But all said the sector was in a tight spot.

Post-pandemic travel demand has rebounded globally, prompting airlines to order new, more efficient planes to expand networks and cut costs, particularly in Asia Pacific.

Giants Airbus and Boeing (NYSE: ) are struggling to meet demand.

""Next year's deliveries will be nine months late from the contracted time,"" Michael Szucs, chief executive of Philippine budget airline Cebu Pacific, told Reuters on the sidelines of Asia's largest aviation summit, referring to new Airbus aircraft.

Lead times to procure items such as metals and windshields can be 2 to 5 times longer compared with pre-2020, firms told Reuters, because of reduced production of aerospace materials, loss of skilled manpower during the pandemic, and reduced supply sources caused by the war in Ukraine.

""The aerospace-grade titanium shortage started with the Ukraine war,"" said Roberto Tonna, chief executive of aerospace supply chain firm ALA. There are also shortages of materials such as inconel and steel, and skilled labour, he added.

""We got quoted 72 weeks for a product that usually we would get in 36-40 weeks ... I think it would take 18-24 months to go back to the way it was before,"" Tonna said.

Prices for some parts have surged, said Paul Bolton, chief operations officer of maintenance firm First Aviation Services, saying he had seen increases of 20%-30% on some compared with more typical 3%-6% annual increases.

Some metals are difficult and expensive to source because of increased demand from countries beefing up their defence capabilities, said Joseph Yun of Bibus Metals, which supplies high-performance metals.

Since late 2023 hundreds of planes with GTF engines by RTX subsidiary Pratt & Whitney have been subject to temporary groundings for engine inspections, which can take up to a year and look set to continue for years.

Maintenance firm Lufthansa Technik, part of German aviation group Lufthansa said it is hiring more staff, bulk buying more parts and developing its own repair solutions to fulfil customer agreements on time.

""The previous supply concept was probably 'just in time'; I order when I need it. This is over,"" said Dennis Kohr, head of Asia-Pacific corporate sales at Lufthansa Technik.

Cebu Pacific is keeping more spare parts locally, Szucs said.

""We have to carry more resiliency than ever in terms of our operations,"" including a higher level of standby aircraft and crew, he said. ""That's one of the costs of uncertainty.""

(Reuters) - Air Canada said on Friday that it will cap fares and add more than 6,000 seats in some markets operated by Lynx Air in light of the imminent suspension of operations by the troubled Canadian budget airline.

Air Canada said that the measures would help Lynx Air customers impacted by the shut down of the airline to return home or make alternative arrangements for planned trips.

Calgary-based Lynx Air filed for court protection from creditors on Thursday, and said it would cease operations from Feb. 26 as it grapples with higher operating costs, fuel prices, and airport charges.

According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, Lynx has 9 Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX 8 in service and is scheduled to operate 569 flights in February.

Air Canada said the capped fares will be available for purchase before Feb. 26 for travel across Canada up until April 2, to aid travel during the spring break and Easter holiday periods.

The added capacity of above 6,000 seats on Lynx Air routes will be available in certain locations in Canada, as well as the U.S., and Cancun in Mexico between Feb. 25 and March 19, the airline said.

Air Canada added that flights were already ""relatively full"" due to high demand during the winter travel period, and its ability to increase capacity further was limited.

WestJet, Air Canada's smaller rival, has also promised to offer discounts on routes previously served by Lynx."

ARLINGTON, Va. - Boeing (NYSE: ) Co. [NYSE: BA] has appointed Uma Amuluru as its new Chief Human Resources Officer and executive vice president, Human Resources, effective April 1. Amuluru will take over from Michael D'Ambrose, who is set to retire in July after a tenure marked by advocacy for Boeing's workforce and the modernization of its human resources department.

Amuluru's responsibilities will encompass Boeing's talent planning, global talent acquisition, learning and development, compensation and benefits, and diversity and inclusion initiatives. She will report directly to Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun and join the company's Executive Council.

With a background that includes serving as Boeing's first chief compliance officer and vice president and general counsel to Boeing Defense, Space & Security, Amuluru brings a wealth of experience to her new role. Her previous positions also include significant roles in the U.S. government, such as counselor to the U.S. Attorney General and Associate White House Counsel to President Barack Obama.

Calhoun praised Amuluru as a leader adept at building strong teams and enhancing organizational capabilities. He emphasized the importance of Boeing's global workforce in maintaining quality and stakeholder confidence. Calhoun also acknowledged D'Ambrose's contributions to Boeing, highlighting his role in talent development and HR modernization during a challenging period for the company.

D'Ambrose, who joined Boeing in July 2020, will assist in the leadership transition before his retirement. His extensive business experience includes leading global human resources teams across various industries.

This leadership change is based on a press release statement issued by Boeing.

(Reuters) - Fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: ) said on Thursday it was unable to reasonably estimate the financial impact of an incident last month that led to a temporary grounding of Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX 9 planes and a production cap on the planemaker.

Spirit, in a regulatory filing, flagged the impact as part of its risk factors and provided a general warning that production levels for the 737 MAX or other aircraft programs could be reduced beyond current expectations.

After a door plug blowout in mid-air, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last month took the unprecedented step of capping Boeing's 737 production at 38 planes per month, which is lower than the planemaker had previously advised suppliers.

Spirit said in the filing that 45% of its revenue had come from the 737 program in 2023 and added changes in production schedules could impact its ability to comply with contractual obligations as well as its liquidity position and financial condition.

The company said this month it would invest in autonomous technology to limit any defects in its production of 737 fuselages."

By Xinghui Kok

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Record numbers attended the trade section of the first fully post-pandemic Singapore Airshow this week, with exhibitors and delegates optimistic about the aviation industry despite suppliers' struggles to keep up with rebounding travel demand.

Close to 60,000 people attended the four trade days of the show, nearly four times as many as in 2022 when foreign visitors required daily rapid tests for COVID-19, and more than the 54,000 who visited in 2018. The 2020 edition was rocked by last-minute cancellations as the virus spread around the world.

Outside Asia's largest air show, transport problems snarled arrivals and departures, especially during the first days. On Tuesday, lines for free shuttle buses to the Expo public transport hub led to waits as long as three hours in temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and taxis to the city cost as much as three times the usual fare.

""'Worst transport experience': Crawling traffic, long waits for rides frustrate Singapore Airshow visitors"", ran a headline in local newspaper the Straits Times.

Leck Chet Lam, managing director of show organiser Experia, blamed ""higher attendance than in previous editions"".

In the air-conditioned display space, commercial exhibitors hawked planes, drones, surveillance technology, services and equipment. The displays attracted buyers and enthusiasts, with the Korea Aerospace Industries booth drawing a line on Wednesday for attendees to get pilots' autographs and pose for selfies.

More than 1,000 commercial and defence companies from 50 countries participated in the show, organisers said.

Russian companies did not take part amid the war in Ukraine but Israeli companies Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which dropped out of the Dubai Airshow in November amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, attended.

""The general mood is extremely positive but also very demanding,"" said Dennis Kohr, head of corporate sales Asia-Pacific for aircraft maintenance provider Lufthansa Technik Group.

""It's the first air show after the pandemic; there is not only a huge demand for air travel, but also huge demand for MRO services,"" he added, referring to maintenance, repair and overhaul.

Natasha Pheiffer, regional managing director for Asia at British defence firm BAE Systems (LON: ), said it was great to see attendees face to face again.

""We had a really busy week ... discussing future air capability, our space and autonomous air technologies, our cyber, electronic warfare, sea, and land offering and our presence across Asia,"" she said.

AERIAL DISPLAY

Delegates stepped into the tropical heat for around an hour of aerial displays each day, including demonstration flights by air force teams from Singapore, South Korea and India, among others, and a fly-by by the C919, made by China's COMAC. It was the first flight outside Chinese territory for COMAC's homegrown jet.

COMAC was also the first company to announce orders at the show, flagging a deal with Tibet Airlines for 40 C919 single-aisle planes and 10 ARJ21 regional jets, plus six ARJ21s for China's Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group.

Shortly afterwards, Royal Brunei Airlines said it was ordering four Boeing (NYSE: ) 787-9 Dreamliners.

Airbus announced an order for five A350 freighters and three A330neo widebody passenger jets from Taiwan's Starlux Airlines. Airbus also had a provisional deal with Vietnamese budget carrier VietJet for 20 A330neo wide-body airliners.

Sustainability was in focus, with Singapore announcing a green jet fuel mandate to be funded by a levy on travellers and air show organisers stressing the importance of protecting the environment, but the industry remains divided over how to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Supply chain issues clouded some of the show's optimism, with exhibitors citing long lead times and high costs, which have dogged the industry since COVID and worsened after Russia invaded Ukraine. The problems have been especially acute for raw materials such as aerospace-grade metals.

Still, Paul Bolton, chief operating officer of First Aviation Services, was hopeful the worst was over and that growing demand would lead manufacturers back to aerospace production.

""It will get better in maybe two to three years,"" he said."

(Reuters) - Aerospace giants including Airbus, Boeing (NYSE: ) and GE Aerospace on Thursday announced the formation of a coalition that would aim to prevent unauthorized parts from entering the global supply chain.

The move comes after jet engine maker CFM International, co-owned by GE Aerospace and France's Safran (EPA: ), last year said thousands of engine components may have been sold with forged paperwork by British distributor AOG Technics.

The group, Aviation Supply Chain Integrity Coalition, was launched on Thursday and would include senior representatives from American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ), Safran, StandardAero and United Airlines, according to a statement.

Former National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt and former U.S. Transportation Deputy Secretary John Porcari will serve as coalition co-chairs, the statement added.

""Through this coalition, we will work to find lasting solutions that the industry can adopt to improve the overall integrity of the aviation supply chain,"" Porcari said."

And now I’d like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen.

Glenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings’ fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a solid finish to 2023 as fourth quarter room nights slightly exceeded our expectations and grew a bit more than 9% year-over-year or 11% when excludes Israel from both periods. When compared to 2019, our room nights grew 21% versus our expectations of 20%. We delivered record fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which were ahead of our expectations. Finally, the GAAP and earnings per share in the quarter grew 29% year-over-year, helped by the reduction in our share count versus last year. At the start of 2024, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. As we look to the year ahead, we see strong growth on the books for travel that’s scheduled to take place in 2024, which gives early indications of potentially another record summer travel season. As we’ve noted previously, a high percentage of these bookings are capable and what is on the books today for the summer period represents a small percentage of the total bookings that we expect to ultimately receive. David will provide further details on fourth quarter results and on our thoughts about the first quarter and full year 2024. Looking back at the full year of 2023, I am proud of our efforts to drive more benefits to our travelers and supply partners while also delivering record-setting industry-leading financial results. We reached a significant milestone last year with our customers’ booking an all-time high of over 1 billion room nights on our platform, which was an increase of 17% versus 2022. Gross bookings of $151 billion increased 24% versus 2022. In 2023, we reached a new revenue record of over $21 billion, which was 25% higher than 2022. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with record adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 billion, an increase of 34% versus 2022, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by over 2 percentage points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of about $152 increased 52% year-over-year and was 48% higher than our prior full year all-time high back in 2019. Across all of our key metrics in 2023, we were a meaningfully larger and faster-growing business than we were in 2019. Our ambition going forward in a normalized growth in market for the travel industry is to continue to grow our gross bookings, revenue and earnings per share faster than we did in 2019. We are confident we will achieve these objectives because we’ve invested in building a stronger business and better product offerings for our travelers and partners that we had back then. We can see this in many areas, but I will highlight a few examples of where we have strengthened our offering relative to 2019. We now have a scaled up merchant platform at Booking.com, which processed first half of Booking.com’s gross bookings in 2023. Our merchant offering brings many benefits to our travelers and partners as well as new strategic benefits to us, including the ability to merchandise. We have continued to scale up our offering at Booking.com since in 2019, with total company air tickets booked in 2023 up more than 400% over that time frame, primarily driven by Booking.com. We see this vertical bring new customers to our platform while delivering a more complete offering to our existing customers making travel planning and booking easier for them and creating opportunities to provide more value to them. On alternative accommodations, we continue to increase the mix of our alternative accommodations room nights, which treats 33% of Booking.com’s room rights in 2023 as we improve our product offering and increase our supply choices with further opportunities ahead, particularly in the U.S. Early, we are pleased that for Booking.com, we have created foundations necessary to offer insurance, attractions and ground transportation options and expect these offerings to add value to our connected trip vision. On marketing, we’ve improved our abilities in using performance marketing channels even more effectively and are now better focused on our brand spending. On loyalty, we’ve expanded and enhanced our loyalty program, Booking.com to deliver more benefits to more of our traveler customers with more of our property and rental car partners participating. And lastly, we are continuing to strengthen the direct relationship with our travelers as our mobile app room nights and total direct room nights continue to increase in our mix. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, which we believe will grow faster than GDP growth across our core markets. With that foundation of industry growth and the improvements we’ve made to strengthen our offerings, we are positive about our future and believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. With our long-term positive outlook, solid financial performance and strong balance sheet, we returned over $10 billion to shareholders during 2023 by repurchasing our shares. Returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. And today, we are taking another important step in that journey by announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend to complement our existing share repurchase program. David will provide further thoughts on our approach to capital returns in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2023, we made meaningful progress against our key strategic priorities, which include: advancing our connected trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, supporting our supply partners and growing alternative accommodations and building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make planning, booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe this is important because we know the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating to travelers than it should be. The contribution aims to greatly improve that experience for consumers which we believe will drive further differentiation of our offerings and lead to improved loyalty, increase direct bookings, higher frequency and a greater share of total travel spend on our platform over time. This is good not only for our travelers, but also for our partner suppliers who will be able to utilize different elements of the connected trip to obtain additional business in an efficient and lower cost way. As we continue to make progress in developing the connected trip, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that moves us closer to this long-term vision. This approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. In fact, some of the key improvements to our platform over the last few years that I spoke about earlier were driven by our work on the connected trip. For example, our emerging platform at Booking.com is a foundational base to the connected trip, and it helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Plus, it enables us to smartly merchandise a variety of partner and self-supply offers when appropriate. Another example would be the development of flights on Booking.com, with flights being one of the most important elements of travel outside of accommodations. In 2023, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 58% year-over-year driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com site offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical, and are encouraged by the right that these customers book other services on our platform. Outside of flights and accommodations, we need solid progress in expanding the breadth of our attraction supply that is available to our travelers. While we do not expect attractions to be a major financial contributor on its own, we see benefits from a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities as we will see ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination. Overall, we believe we have made great progress in building toward our Connected revision and we are starting to see early signs of the benefits. We continue to see a growing percentage of transactions, which we count as connectors though these are still a small percentage of our total transactions today. Importantly, we see these types of customers returning to us more frequently, and we point to experiment with expanding Genius program to include all travel verticals in 2024, which we expect will drive more value to travelers across the different elements of the connected trip. We plan to continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will result in increased travel and supplier engagement with our platform. In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. Over the last few quarters, I have discussed the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com’s AI trip planner and Priceline’s generative AI travels – named Penny. After launching Booking.com’s AI trip planner in the U.S. last summer, we expanded the rollout to the UK market in the fourth quarter. At this early stage, the team remains focused. I learn more about customers who want to interact with the tool and what types of questions they will ask. We see the AI trip planner is getting better answering customers’ inquiries and we are excited to start testing other verticals out of accommodations. At Priceline, last week, they announced their weaker product release, which included several enhancements to Penny following 6 months of real-world interaction with users that resulted in valuable learnings from the Priceline team. Priceline’s AI travel assisted product can now help travelers be on just the hotel category as it now covers flights, car rentals and vacation packages. While was nicely launched at the end of the booking funnel on the checkout page, it is now available on the Priceline homepage where it can help with travel planning, booking and modifying a trip as we booked. This is a clear example of how our teams iterate and enhance our AI-powered products as we learn more through user interactions. We continue to see encouraging signs that Priceline’s Penny product helps lower customer service contact across travel verticals, and we believe, improves the customer experience. Beyond improving customer service contact rates, we believe that, over time, we can leverage generative AI technology to help make our customer service agents more efficient across our entire Outside of customer service, we continue to explore areas where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity. We have early indications that using generative AI enhances the productivity of our software developers and are encouraged by the results so far. We look forward to experimenting with these and other ways Gen AI tools might make our business more efficient in the future. Turning to our supply partners. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. And we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental bookings and developing products and features to help support their businesses. The majority of our partners are small independent businesses, and we are pleased to see many are reporting significantly improved business performance over the last year. We believe that helping our smaller partners thrive contributes to the long-term diversity and sustainability of our sector. One area in which we work with many small independent businesses is through our alternative combination offering comp. This is an area which we have continued to strengthen our business, increasing supply and raising product awareness on many travelers. Also combination room nights grew 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year, which was faster our traditional hotel category. We saw meaningfully higher growth in our U.S. alternative accommodation room nights, though this is all a relatively small Globally, alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com’s total room nights in 2023, which was 3 percentage points higher than in 2022. Our strong trend of accommodation room nights growth is benefiting from having more listings available on our platform were travelers to choose from. We are seeing continued momentum in annual turn combination supply both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about 7.4 million by the end of 2023, which is about 12% higher than the 6.6 million last year. We’re focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. I am encouraged that in 2023 at Booking.com, we had strong growth in our base of our peak bookers, demonstrating strong retention, while we’re also pleased with the increase in the number of new users to our platform versus 2022. We’re also strengthening the direct relationship with our travelers as our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continues to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter and when measured for the full year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Our mix overnight through our mobile apps increased year-over-year by about 5 percentage points for the full year to 49%. Booking.com remained the number one downloaded travel app in the world in 2023. In Asia, Booking.com and Agoda are top five travel apps. And in the U.S. Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable are all in the top 10 travel apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. Finally, I want to briefly address a regulatory matter that’s impacting the financial results we are reporting today. The Spanish Competition Authority has issued a draft decision alleging infringement by Booking.com of Spanish competition law and then intends to issue a fine of $530 million. We could not disagree more with this draft decision and the arbitrarily large fine that they imposed, which is completely disproportionate to the alleged conduct. If the draft decision were to become fine, we plan to appeal. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels and other accommodation partners around the world. We provide exceptional choice, value and service for travelers and we provide a marketplace for hotels and other partners that allows them to attract travelers from around the world at lower cost than many other marketing channels. We have a clear track record of cooperating with many competition and consumer authorities to find amicable and workable solutions to their concerns, including working with the year being commission on the Digital Markets Act. As we have previously disclosed, we plan to file our notification for designation under the DMA suit. And we believe the main concerns raised by the Spanish Authority overlap with the DMA. We will continue to work closely with these regulatory bodies to maintain consistent rules. And most importantly, we will continue to ensure that we are offering the best possible platform to our partners and our customers. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong fourth quarter results and the continued of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well over the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.

David Goulden: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we see in the first quarter and – on 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. One housekeeping item before discussing our results. We have reclassified digital services taxes into sales and other expenses and out of G&A expense. Due to the highly variable nature of GSTs, which are tied to the revenue earned in the countries where GST are enacted. We have provided a table with two areas of updated quarterly financials in our earnings press release that reflects this chain P&L geography, and all of my comments on this call will also reflect the change. Now on to our quarter results. Our room nights in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year and 21% versus 2019, which was slightly better than our expectations of about 9% and 20%. Excluding Israel, Q4 room rights were up 11% versus 2022 and 22% versus 2019. Looking at our year-over-year room nights by region in the fourth quarter, Asia was up mid-teens Europe was up low double digits, Rest of World was up low single digits, and the U.S. was flat. All regions improved from October. The average booking window of Booking.com expanded in Q4 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, but was a bit less expanded than it was in the third quarter. In Q4, mobile app mix of about 53% was about 5 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. The international mix of our room nights in Q4 was 50%, up from about 48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and reaching about the same level as the pre-pandemic Q4 mix. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was slightly higher than Q4 2022, impacted by the war in the Middle East. As we expected, the higher overall cancellation in October normalized by the end of the quarter. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q4 room night growth was 19% year-over-year, and the global mix of alternative body room nights was about 32%, which was up versus about 29% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 gross bookings increased 16% year-over-year or about 15% on a constant currency basis, which was ahead of our expectations. The 16% increase in gross bookings was 7 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus over 1 percentage point of positive impact from each of FX movements and flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was natively impacted by regional mix due to higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. Despite higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch the dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 46% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com’s flight offering. Revenue for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 18% year-over-year or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1%, which was about in line with our expectations. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 9% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q4 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of business. Performance margin ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 was about 15 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation due to lower merchandising expense, higher direct mix and better performance marketing ROIs. Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 20 basis points compared with last year and also about 20 basis points above our expectation normalize for the DST reclassification, due in large parts to higher accounts receivable provisions related to our decision to delay some collections during the partner payment issue we discussed last quarter. We do not expect this to be an ongoing issue. More fixed expenses in aggregate were up 21% year-over-year, which was below our expectations primarily due to lower personnel and IT expense as well as due to the DST reclassification. 21% is calculated usually on non-GAAP expenses in both Q4 2023 and Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA of almost $1.5 billion was ahead of our expectation and was up 18% year-over-year and would have been about 22% on a constant currency basis. Separately, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $37 million loss recorded in other income related to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, which is not factored into our prior guidance. This reduced Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin by almost 1%. Non-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $32 a share, which was up 29% year-over-year. Our average share count in the fourth quarter was 9% below Q4 2022. Our non-GAAP results exclude $276 million or expense in personnel related to a ruling in the Netherlands pension fund matter and $530 million of expense in G&A related to a draft decision by a Spanish Competition Authority. I’d like to provide some perspective on each of these. As Glenn mentioned, we strongly disagree with the draft decision and unprecedented fine proposed by Spanish Competition Authority, which we plan to appeal if it becomes final. The appeal process could take a few years. During any appeal process, we would expect to influence some changes to our business practices in Spain, we do not currently undertake that these will have a significant impact on our business. Turning to the Dutch pension case. In January, the court of appeal in the ruled the most Booking.com employees in the Netherlands should enroll – in a travel industry-wide pension fund. The liability we recorded in our Q4 results is for prior periods related to this pension plan. We’re working through how we align this travel industry-wide plan with the existing pension plan we offer to our employees in the Netherlands. We expect there will be some increase in our pension plan costs in the Netherlands going forward, but we do not expect these to be material. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $222 million in the quarter. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our – 2023 room nights grew 17% year-over-year, and our gross bookings grew 24% and about 25% on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $21 million, which was up 25% year-over-year and up similarly on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.2% in 2023, which is up slightly versus 14.1% in 2022. For the full year, there is more than 0.5 points of positive impact from timing as well the benefit to take rates from increased revenues associated with payments, but this was mostly offset by an increase in the mix of flights, an increase in Asia mix has really recovered and by our increased investments in merchandising. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. For the full year, our marketing plus merchandising at Booking.com as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.6%, down from 5.9% in 2022, driven by marketing efficiencies and direct mix. The 5.6% in 2023 is still up from 5.5% in 2019 and are leading into a recovered travel market more than offset gains due to increased direct mix. For the full year, the direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, continue to increase in mix. When we exclude our B2B or business-to-business, our direct mix was in the low 60% range for the year. Our full year EBITDA was more than $7 million and was up 34% year-over-year and up about 37% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which was 12 percentage points higher than our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 and in-line with our expectations at the start of the year. Our full year non-GAAP earnings per share was about $152 a share, which is up 52% year and up about 58% on a constant currency basis. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $13.1 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $14.3 billion due to the $2.4 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we generated $7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased over $10 billion worth of shares in 2023, taking our remaining repurchase authorization down to $14 billion and reducing our year-end share count by 9% versus 2022 and by 16% versus 2021, which is just before we restarted our share repurchase program. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we remain focused on appropriately investing in our business and growing returns for our shareholders while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings. Given our confidence in our earnings power, strong free cash flow profile and our ability to consistently shareholders, we are announcing today that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $8.75 per share to complement our existing share repurchase program. The dividend is payable March 28, 2024 to shareholders record on March 8, 2024. We believe the introduction of a dividend will allow us to enhance our capital return program and further expand our base of investors. In terms of composition of capital returns, we expect the share repurchases will represent the vast majority of our total capital return to shareholders going forward. We continue to expect to complete the $24 billion share repurchase authorization we announced early 2023 within 4 years where we started, which would be before the end of 2026. We reiterate our previously stated gross leverage target 2x, and our goal to move to a 1x net leverage over time. The initiation of a dividend does not change our thinking around these targets. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter of 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis. Given that we’re now beyond the COVID period, when granular short-term information was helpful in assessing the path – we’re returning to our historical guidance approach with outcome range for the full quarter ahead and less detail on monthly trends and individual P&L line items. Based on the solid travel demands we’ve seen so far in the first quarter, we expect Q1 room night growth to be between 4% and 6%. We expect the ongoing war in the Middle East have a negative 1% impact on Q1 room night growth. We’re also comparing with a strong start to the year in 2023 when we started to see an expansion of the booking window. January room night growth was above the high end of that range. As we move through the quarter, every room bank growth will benefit from an extra day, our March room night growth will be hurt by Easter being in March. We expect these to roughly offset each other. We expect Q1 gross bookings growth to be between 5% and 7%, about 1 percentage point faster than room night growth due to slightly higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and faster growth from flights, partially offset by about 1 percentage point of FX pressure. We expect Q1 revenue growth will be between 11% and 13%, faster than Q1 bookings growth due in part to the Easter shift, which we expect to bear the Q1 revenue by about 3 percentage points. We expect a similar native impact on revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be between $680 million and $720 million, which at the midpoint would be 19% year-on-year growth and about a 1 percentage point increase in EBITDA margin. We expect EBITDA margin to bank from market expenses growing slower than revenue and growing similar to gross bookings, which we expect will more than offset our fixed OpEx growth growing slightly faster than revenue. As we set our course to the full year ahead, I want to first address our longer-term ambition for growth in our business. As we’ve discussed previously, in a more normalized market environment, we’re aiming to achieve constant currency growth rates for gross booking revenue and earnings per share that are higher than what we achieved in 2019. This would remain growing above 8% for each of the top line metrics and about 15% for earnings per share. We believe we’ll be able to achieve these levels of growth, given the investments we made to build a stronger business and a better offering for our travelers and partners versus what we had 5 years ago. At recent FX rates, we expect changes in FX will negatively impact our reported growth rate by a little more than 1 percentage point. With that framework and with FX in mind, we expect to grow our full year 2024 slightly faster than 7% and including the assumption that the war in the Middle East will negatively impact our full year 2024 growth rate by 1%. We expect revenue for the year to grow at similar rate to our gross bookings growth. We expect a more fixed expense in 2024 to grow in the low to mid-teens. We are planning to leverage from these more fixed expenses in 2025. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will grow slightly faster than revenue, largely due to expectations for an increased direct mix. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than a percentage point. Lastly, we expect EPS growth to be above 40%. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results, our Q1 outlook and our expectation in 2024 to grow faster than 2019 across gross bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS with exceeding EBITDA margin year-over-year. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for us. We’ll now move to Q&A. Sarah, will you please open the lines?

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.

Justin Post: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. One for David, and I guess this might be your last call, I would love to hear about your – who you are on CFO transition. But the guidance, is January growing above the 4% to 6% for room nights? I thought January might have tougher comps. So, maybe talk a little bit about the shape of the quarter. And then maybe bigger picture for Glenn. Just was wondering, you have so much data as the share leader in room nights. How do you think the AI transition could play out for booking? And do you think you have some advantages versus search engines or your peers? How you are thinking about that? Thank you.

David Goulden: Yes, Justin thanks. Let me take the first one, and handover to Glenn for the second one. So, yes, as I have said in my remarks, just to reiterate, January is – did grow faster than the high end of the 4% to 6% range that we talked about. It did benefit, we believe, slightly maybe in the range of about 1% from the shift of Chinese New Year this year, which we expect to be offset in February. And as we said, we would expect therefore, February and March to have a lower growth rate, in January, essentially consistent with our prior guidance of expecting deceleration during the quarter.

Glenn Fogel: Thanks Dave for that. And Justin, AI, obviously incredibly important subject for everybody in any business right now. And I think I talked about it at the last call and have been talking about it a lot whenever I speak about how important this is for anybody who is looking to the future to create something that could be transformational. We are very early, as I have said in the past. I like pointing out the things that we have done so far and some of the early signs we see that this is going to be just fantastic for us. Nobody knows how long it will take. One of the things I love is us being in a position because of our financial position, because of the number of people we have who have capabilities to look into this. Because of the data we have, as you pointed out, that people can then be able to use it to create models and use it in ways that are complementary to other people, are doing in terms of creating large language models and so on. I do believe we have an advantage because of our size and scale and the capabilities of our people to create something in all parts of the business, whether it would be, as I discussed, things that help the traveler, which are the sort of products there or helping us in the back part of our business, the back office and make these more efficient, going throughout. I think we do have an advantage, of course, we will see over time how well and how quickly we can actually translate that into better numbers in terms of margins, in terms of more people coming to us, people increasing loyalty, etcetera. But I am very encouraged with what I am seeing so far. And I certainly believe that we do have the full position here in the travel industry.

David Goulden: Justin, just before we hand back to the operator for the next question. I just want to reiterate two other things I said about the Q1 room night guide. This is growth after the impact of about a point of hurt from the Middle East. And of course, we are comping against a very strong start to last year when we saw room nights of the booking window moving from a contracted position to an expanded position in the first quarter that also created some strong results in Q1 last year. So, you have to factor those things into account as well.

Justin Post: Great. Thank you. And David, this is your last call. We will miss you. Thanks for all the work over the years.

David Goulden: Thanks Justin.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.

Kevin Kopelman: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about marketing. First, merchandising was only up slightly in the mix or only up slightly as a percentage of GBV, I should say, 2023. Do you feel that that’s reached a steady state in the mix, or do you see incremental pushes this year in merchandising? And then on advertising, are you seeing any changes to the bidding environment?

David Goulden: Okay. Yes. So Kevin, so we have now, I think as you characterize, we can ask here with our merchandising activities that’s been something that we have been ramping up over time, Booking.com. And I think we now kind of deploy it in place in where we plan to deploy it. So, it has reached more of a state and new store, only a slight increase in merchandising in total from last year to this year as a percentage of GBV. So, when we kind of look at our model going forward, we do expect that across marketing merchandising with our continued increase in direct mix, that can be a source of leverage for us. And of course, as I mentioned in my commentary about the full year, that will be the biggest driver of our EBITDA margin expansion this year and will be joined by OpEx next year. And then relative to the competitive environment, it stays competitive. I mean these are very competitive markets. There are many players in there. I think people realize it’s not just the OTAs, there are meta players, there are hotel players, there are chains you name it, a lot of people are bidding in these marketplaces. So, I think it just remains competitive, but we are pleased with how we are doing in a competitive marketplace.

Glenn Fogel: And Kevin, just a reference back to Justin’s question about AI and data and merchandising, how we do it, etcetera. One of the great things I really see about our position is that using data, using all things you know to merchandise smartly. Do it where we think it’s going to give us an advantage and not do it where we are just giving away money. And I really see as all as AI technology develops further, as we begin to optimize over time, with all the different parts of the connected trip, we are going to be able to provide value to both the travelers and be able to get our suppliers to help provide merchandising opportunities and us doing an intelligent way. So, it’s win for the traveler, win for the partner and us as the people are doing all this, we will also win.

Kevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks Glenn.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.

Mark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. In terms of your guidance for the full year on the margins side, what are you embedding in there in terms of marketing or sales and marketing spend and merchandising spend as a percentage of bookings? Are you assuming a little bit of leverage in there? And I am sorry if you covered that in your published comments, but if you could answer that. And then secondly, on the buybacks in Q3, I think they were a little – in Q4, I think they were a little bit lower than in Q3, was that your intention? Was there a particular reason why you maybe – may have been a little less active than the market in Q4? Thank you very much.

David Goulden: Alright. Thank you, Mark. I will take those. So, as I have said in the prepared remarks, the biggest driver of leverage we expect this year on EBITDA margin going to be from our direct mix increase, which means that we will have a small sustain to the business, which has paid a higher percent of mix and therefore, we would expect to get some leverage on marketing and merchandise. We expect to continue to be aggressive and still lead into the markets where we are spending money on paid marketing and we don’t necessarily – we are offsetting anything about our ROI on that to tip any hand, but we would expect that it would be the direct mix increase. It will be the driver of leverage in marketing and merchandising therefore would be the driver of improvement in our EBITDA margins. On the buybacks in Q4, I think they are roughly same in size to Q3. At the start of Q4, where share price was lower, we said if the share price stays at a lower level, we will buy more in Q4 than we did in Q3. Share price moved up during the quarter, and we take share price into account when thinking about the level of buybacks and of course we have taken the long-term view. But in the short-term, we do moderate based upon how share price moves. So, that’s perhaps why it’s being a little bit less than you may have expected. A little bit less than we perhaps indicated on the last earnings call, but still a big number and still over $10 billion for the year as you see a significant reduction in our share count…

Mark Mahaney: Thank you, David. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Doug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on the full year outlook. I mean it sounds like you are very confident in the business overall. Just does the full year outlook reflect just normalization of trends in ‘24? The tough comp and the Middle East impact that you mentioned, is there anything else to consider here? Thanks.

David Goulden: Yes. I think there is a couple of things to bear in mind in the full year outlook. Bear in mind, we talked about our framework. So, we said that we would grow faster than 8 and 8.15 on a constant currency basis. And we are saying we are going to do that with the impact of the Middle East on slowing our business down. So, I think that is a positive outlook. Of course, we have adjusted the numbers to a reported number. So, when you include the FX shift at current rates of roughly 1%, then the 8, 8.15 becomes 7, 7.4. But again, it’s essentially 8, 8.15 on a constant currency basis, and we expect to be higher than that even with roughly a point of hurt to the business on the top line and the bottom line from what’s happening in the Middle East. So, it’s consistent with our framework and I believe is confident of our position of the travel market and our continued ability to gain share in travel.

Doug Anmuth: Thank you, David.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Brian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions guys. I have two sort of on the U.S. The first one, when you talk about the U.S. being flat, does that include alternative accommodations? So, is the hotel business in the U.S. actually declining then? That’s the first one. And then just sort of, Glenn, as you look into 2024, what are the investments you have to make in the U.S., both on the hotel side as well as the alternative accommodation side to sort of drive more and more durable, consistent growth from here?

David Goulden: Yes. I will start with the first one, back to Glenn, the second one. So, U.S. was flat for the quarter, but bear in mind, it was down in October. And October, it was driven very much by the kind of ripple shock effect of the – what was happening in the Middle East. So, therefore it was back into growth mode in November and December in order to put our plant for the quarter. So, I wouldn’t read too much into a whole quarter that you have got to kind of look what happened in October. Yes, that doesn’t call alternatives. As Glenn said, alternative grew very nicely in the U.S., but it’s a much lower mix of our business in the U.S. than it is in other parts of the world. So, again, I wouldn’t go too much into assuming that means that hotels are…

Glenn Fogel: Yes. And regarding – the question regarding how we are going to do even better in the U.S., we have talked about the numbers that we have shown so far. I am very pleased you look back to 2019, see what our steer was, that what numbers we then look at them now, it goes really fantastic growth and great work by the team. I think last quarter, I had out to the team then and I will do it again because they are doing fantastic work. One of the things is because the under-indexed, because we are smaller in terms of not clear [ph] of the U.S. versus other parts, this is a great opportunity for us. And I have talked about we have to continue to improve our product particularly in the alternative accommodation on account of that, and we have been doing that. And that’s why we have this large growth rate in the U.S. alternative accommodations. Very pleased to see that happening. They continue to provide to our hotel partners what they need and what they want is incremental demand. They don’t want us to be a provider to manage they think they can always get. And one of the great things about our team is working closely with our hotel partners. As you know, a lot of the U.S. is large chains, and we have developed, I think a very good relation with them to work together to help them, do what they need to do to achieve their results and us being a provider of those services and getting what we need, which is more bookings. I am pleased with the results we have done so far. And I think we have got a great opportunity to continue to do so for a long time.

Brian Nowak: Thank you both.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open.

James Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Two here, I think Glenn, you talked about maybe increasing supply of home accommodation – alternative accommodation in the U.S. Can you elaborate, maybe talk about that plan a little bit, help us understand your strategy there. And also secondly, I think you guys talked about maybe on the loyalty program to include all verticals in 2024 would be great, you provide some details there as well. Thanks.

Glenn Fogel: Thanks James. And I didn’t quite get the second one. Let’s start with the first one, maybe in front of the second one. So, it’s interesting because in our last call, I went into a little bit about what do we need to do to increase that supply of alternative combinations. And I talked a little bit – and this is that high, it wasn’t the first time I talked about this. Where we have – while we are even into urban and rural and such, I have talked in the past, though, how we don’t have as many of the single properties that perhaps some of our competitors have less area down the road. But the whole idea is we want to do things efficiently and want do things effectively, which means it goes through the things where you can get larger groups of properties listing quicker by going to the big property managers who have a lot of them. That may be that you are going to end up with more things that are not with single home properties. But then after we have that enough, and that’s the low-hanging fruit after we got that comes, then we got to go on and start getting more of the single homes, etcetera. And I have expressed my own disappointment that when I look for a single property sometimes I have mentioned, at one point on the call about wanting to get something out in the Hampton and New York for the summer and not seeing enough properties for us. There is lots of opportunity. But I look at this as an opportunity, not as a negative, but then you look how well we are doing, even though there is all the other stuff to go out and get. That’s the way I feel about it, and I am pleased the way the team is going out. Look, 12% increase in our listings or $6.6 million, now over $7.4 million, I like the fact that we are increasing those numbers, doing it in a nice size and also particularly really like the fact that our growth rate of return on the combination was significantly higher than some other people in our space. So, I was very happy to see that. I didn’t catch the second part of James’ question.

James Lee: Yes, of course. The second part of the question is about your loyalty program Genius. I think Glenn you had mentioned you want to include all travel verticals into the program this year. And I was wondering if you can provide some details on that.

Glenn Fogel: Sure. Okay. So, what I would said is we are going to experiment. And we really see, we always want to experiment, where do things work, where do we see return for it, where do we see how this is working so well. So, we are going to continue to experiment and we do have, for example, rental cars well established into our Genius program. Obviously, our combination as well and we are going to experiment with all the different verticals. And the thing, is there a way to do in flights, is there a way to do it in track and how do we do it in terms of potentially even insurance, in all sorts of ways, our ride business when people need a ride from the airport to the hotel or hotel to the airport or from their home to the airport. Again, and this goes back to the first question, I think it was Justin asked about AI and about how you use data. And that’s kind of one of the key things is when you have these models, and you can figure out what the best way to provide a benefit, and that’s through our loyalty Genius program, that’s doing that in a way that it provides value to the traveler, that’s where they use us, that’s why they come back to us. That’s why they come to us direct. Maybe they will use the app because it’s so simple to do it. At the same time, Genus is primarily almost right now, primarily being funded by our partners because they see value in that. They see value in providing a discount or some other type of benefit that we put into the offering, so that the travelers will book, that supplier what they want to sell. And doing to get it in a scientific way in doing it in a way that is going to make sure that we are not leaving value out of the cycle in a way that’s not going to be beneficial to our supplier partners, doing it smartly, that’s the thing that I love. And that’s why we are going to continue to experiment on that. And I think it’s worked so well in hotels and I think it’s in a combination, alternative accommodations, I think this is going to work great in all of it. But we will see after we expand it.

James Lee: Great. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Eric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe following up on that last question from James, you talked earlier about connected trip and feeling optimistic about attach rates there, but still work to do. When you think about what you are trying to accomplish with Connected Trip longer term and you think about rising conversion, reducing friction. What do you put it down to? Is it consumer education? Is it supply? How should we be thinking about the building blocks behind connected trip to accomplish your longer term goals? Thank you.

Glenn Fogel: So, if the question was really how do we get from here early stage showing good signs, but it’s still small to scale and really showing the bottom line and top line and a loyalty and all those things, I think that – is that the question really?

Eric Sheridan: It is Glenn. Thanks.

Glenn Fogel: Yes. So, look, one of the things that we have to – and I have said this is a long-term path. And the first thing was we had to build the verticals to begin with. One of the fun things was to mention that we started Booking.com we got off the ground in 2019 and now put all our flight numbers together, you see 400% increase there that’s included, of course, Priceline had placed before that, where you just see the growth rate of flights right now, great. So, we got that vertical up and we got excellences up and attract is still early, but up. But these things – all of these things are the car rental was up, but we still do on that and of course the rides business and others. All of these things are at different levels of development, but still relatively new. And one of that, then we have to build all the modeling, all the ways to figure out what’s the best way to offer one versus the other, and make sure that we are doing it the right way. And then it’s working with our partner suppliers to provide us and prove out to them that this is worthwhile to them. All of these things take time. But I do like to say, we are seeing those signals. We are seeing the numbers. It is early and I am not going to do – I am sure you would like me to give you some numbers, say, here is what it’s going to be tomorrow. Here is what the next milestone. I am going to do that. And I can’t say I see we are on the right path.

Eric Sheridan: Great. Thank you. And thank you for everything David, congrats on the last call and good luck for everything.

David Goulden: Thank you, Eric.

Operator: That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call to Glenn for closing remarks.

Glenn Fogel: Thank you. So, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. And as mentioned by a couple of people on the call, I have to give out a very special thank you to my very good friend and colleague, David Goulden. As you know, after 24 earnings calls as Booking Holdings CFO, he is retiring from this role and will be working on other areas of the business going forward. We greatly appreciate everything that David has done for this company, and we greatly appreciate everyone else’s support as well as we continue to build on the long-term vision of our company. Thank you very much and good night.

Operator: This concludes today’s call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

Why Booking (BKNG) Stock Is Nosediving

BKNG -10.15% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

What Happened: Shares of online travel agency Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: ) fell 9.8% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results that narrowly topped analysts' revenue expectations on better-than-expected gross bookings. It also expanded its user base, which is good to see. However, the number of airline tickets, rental car days, and room nights sold during the quarter fell below Wall Street's expectations. Room nights grew 9% year on year ( versus 15% growth in the previous quarter), signaling a significant demand deceleration. A similar growth decline can be observed in the number of rental car days sold (+11% y/y vs. 20% y/y growth in the previous quarter). The company noted that cancellation rates were above the trend observed in the previous year due to ""the war in the Middle East"". In Q1'2024, it expects a negative 1% impact on Q1 room night growth due to the Middle East conflict while anticipating a similar impact on the full-year 2024 growth rate. Zooming out, this was a mixed but weaker quarter.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Booking? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

What is the market telling us: Booking's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 2 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago, when the stock gained 11% on the news that the company reported second-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations for revenue, gross bookings and earnings per share. Operating metrics such as hotel rooms and airline ticket sales came ahead of Consensus. Unit economics also moved in the right direction.

Management added some positive comments on demand trends stating that ""In the second quarter, we continued to see robust leisure travel demand, which helped drive stronger than expected room nights and gross bookings results in the quarter.""

Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please investors, especially after the company's closest peer Expedia (NASDAQ: ) reported somewhat disappointing results.

Booking is up 1.3% since the beginning of the year, but at $3,527 per share it is still trading 9.6% below its 52-week high of $3,902 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Booking's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,866."

Booking (BKNG) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:

Revenue: $4.78 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.71 billion (1.6% beat)

$4.78 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.71 billion (1.6% beat) EPS (non-GAAP): $32 vs analyst estimates of $30.05 (6.5% beat)

of $1.25 billion, similar to the previous quarter Room Nights Booked: 231 million, up 20 million year on year

231 million, up 20 million year on year Market Capitalization: $130.5 billion

Formerly known as The Priceline Group, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the world’s largest online travel agency.

Online TravelBecause of the enormous number of flights, hotels, and accommodations available, travel is a natural fit for marketplaces that aggregate suppliers, simplifying the shopping process for consumers. Online travel platforms today make up over 50% of the industry’s bookings, a percentage that has been rising for 20 years, and will likely continue in the years ahead.

Sales GrowthBooking's revenue growth over the last three years has been incredible, averaging 68.1% annually. This quarter, Booking beat analysts' estimates and reported 18.2% year-on-year revenue growth.

Usage Growth As an online travel company, Booking generates revenue growth by increasing both the number of stays (or experiences) booked and the commission charged on those bookings.

Over the last two years, Booking's nights booked, a key performance metric for the company, grew 37.4% annually to 231 million. This is among the fastest growth rates of any consumer internet company, indicating that users are excited about its offerings.

In Q4, Booking added 20 million nights booked, translating into 9.5% year-on-year growth.

Revenue Per BookingAverage revenue per booking (ARPB) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Booking because it not only measures how much users book on its platform but also the commission that Booking can charge.

Booking's ARPB growth has been strong over the last two years, averaging 9%. The company's ability to increase prices while rapidly growing its nights booked reflects the strength of its platform, as its bookings continue to book more each year. This quarter, ARPB grew 7.9% year on year to $20.71 per booking.

Key Takeaways from Booking's Q4 Results It was good to see Booking narrowly top analysts' revenue expectations this quarter on better-than-expected gross bookings. We were also glad it expanded its user base. Zooming out, we think this was a decent quarter, showing that the company is staying on target. The market was likely expecting more, and the stock is down 3.9% after reporting, trading at $3,749.99 per share."

BKNG -10.15% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

(Reuters) - Shares of Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: ) fell 8% in early morning trading on Friday, after the online travel agency forecast slower first quarter and full-year growth in bookings as U.S. travel demand normalizes from a post-pandemic boom.

Booking is set to lose roughly $11 billion in market value if losses hold, though Wall Street's reaction to its fourth-quarter results was mixed, with some noting the company's 2024 outlook of slightly higher than 7% growth was conservative.

The company's gross travel bookings grew 24% in 2023, a year when travel demand held firm despite high inflation amid a shift in consumers' spending to services from goods, a phenomenon that sent shares of the sector's firms zooming.

But 2024 forecasts by travel companies and hotel operators including Hilton and Marriott over the last few days have signaled demand is expected to grow more slowly this year, disappointing investors.

""After two plus years of strong stock performance, the room nights booked deceleration could drive a bit of a pause in the shares,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson wrote in a note after Booking's results.

Erickson, however, bumped his price target on the stock to $3,900 from $3,550, citing confidence Booking would return to ""faster-than-market growth"".

Booking's shares had risen about 61% in the last one year, giving it a forward 12-month price-earnings ratio of 20.8, compared with peer Expedia (NASDAQ: )'s 10.7.

""We believe a travel normalization was largely expected for 2024, but given the recent stock move and elevated expectations into earnings, the deceleration (in bookings) is steeper than expected,"" said Doug Anmuth, analyst at J.P. Morgan.

Booking on Thursday also forecast first-quarter gross bookings growth to be between 5% and 7%, much slower than the 44% rise it reported a year earlier.

Booking shares were trading at $3,586 on Friday. Expedia and Airbnb fell 1% each."

BKNG -10.15% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw its share price slide over 9% in premarket trading Friday after its EBITDA/bookings guidance missed expectations.

The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $32 for Q4, surpassing analyst predictions of $29.66. Revenue was reported at $4.8 billion, also above the projected $4.71 billion.

Booking’s gross travel bookings during the quarter totaled $31.7 billion, marking a 16% increase compared to the same period last year.

Apart from its quarterly numbers, Booking also announced a quarterly cash dividend of $8.75 per share, approved by its board.

This dividend is scheduled for payment on March 28, 2024, to shareholders on record as of March 8, 2024.

""We are pleased to report a strong close to 2023 with fourth quarter room nights growing 9% year-over-year or 11% when excluding business associated with Israel, which was significantly impacted by the war,” Booking CEO Glenn Fogel said in a statement.

Looking ahead to FQ1 2024,

For Q1, Booking revenue growth to be between 11% and 13%, and gross bookings to rise between 5% and 7%.

The forecast for adjusted EBITDA ranges from approximately $680 million to $720 million, representing a 19% year-over-year growth and a 1 percentage point rise in EBITDA margin.

Commenting on the report, analysts at Morgan Stanley said the company's bookings/EBITDA guidance was below the broker's prior estimates.

In addition, the analysts also voiced concerns over Booking's flat US room night growth in Q4, which ""feeds concerns around share loss in leisure hotels and speaks to needed execution improvement in 2024.""

Still, analysts believe the strength in alternative accommodations and the promise of capital returns will sustain growth and support valuation multiples.

Morgan Stanley reiterated the Equal Weight rating on the stock and raised the price target to $3,700."

On Friday, Morgan Stanley updated its assessment of Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: ), increasing the price target to $3,700 from the previous $3,000. The firm has maintained its Equalweight rating on the company's shares. This adjustment follows Booking Holdings' guidance for 2024, which forecasts gross bookings and revenue growth of over 7%, a figure that falls short of Morgan Stanley's estimate of approximately 10%. Additionally, the anticipated EBITDA growth rate, expected to be slightly higher than revenue, also did not meet Morgan Stanley's projection of around 14%.

The analyst at Morgan Stanley noted that the flat growth in U.S. room nights during the fourth quarter raises concerns about potential market share loss in the leisure hotel segment. This stagnation indicates a need for Booking Holdings to improve execution in 2024. Despite these challenges, Booking Holdings has shown competitive strength in alternative accommodations, with its alternative accommodation nights growing by 19% in the fourth quarter. This growth represents an addition of around 11 million nights, outpacing Airbnb by approximately 700 basis points and marking the fifth time in seven quarters that Booking Holdings has matched or exceeded the number of room nights added by Airbnb.

Morgan Stanley also highlighted early indications of efficiency gains from Booking Holdings' use of Generative AI. The AI Trip Planner and Penny have reportedly reduced customer service contact rates, while Generative AI tools have increased software developer productivity. Despite a slight downward revision in revenue and EBITDA forecasts for 2024, with a 2% and 3% decrease respectively, the 2025 estimates remain unchanged.

The revised price target of $3,700 is justified by a valuation roll forward and multiples that align with the company's long-term average. Morgan Stanley's price target is based on 14 times the estimated 2025 EBITDA and 18 times the estimated 2025 earnings per share.

(Reuters) - Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, anticipating a surge in demand for its software to design complex and artificial intelligence-compatible chips.

The Sunnyvale, California-based company's shares were up more than 3% in extended trading.

The outlook comes more than a month after Synopsys, the largest maker of software used in the chip designing process, said it would buy Ansys (NASDAQ: ) in a $35 billion cash-and-stock deal.

In an interview, Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi said the company has started filing for regulatory approvals and so far has encountered ""no surprises - there is nothing that we did not anticipate.""

Ghazi also told Reuters that the company hopes to tell investors whether it will sell off its software integrity business by March 20. Synopsys said in December it was evaluating strategic alternatives for the unit.

Synopsys, which partners with chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Samsung Electronics (KS: ), expects second-quarter revenue to be in a range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $1.55 billion, according to LSEG data.

The AI boom has elevated demand for companies such as Synopsys, as its electronic design automation (EDA) tools are used by chip firms for custom semiconductor design in diverse sectors such as aerospace, automotive and industrial.

Chip firms are spending heavily on research and design initiatives to make robust chips with innovative design, which is one of the industry's biggest challenges because billions of transistors - tiny on-off switches - must be precisely arranged on a piece of silicon just a few millimeters wide. That has sparked demand for software provided by Synopsys even as economic uncertainty looms.

Synopsys forecast adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.09 to $3.14 for the second quarter ending April 30, also above analysts' average estimate of $3.02 per share.

The company reiterated its outlook for full-year revenue but raised its annual adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $13.47 to $13.55, from $13.33 to $13.41.

Revenue in the first quarter ended Jan. 31 rose about 21% to $1.65 billion, in line with estimates. Excluding certain items, it earned $3.56 per share, beating the estimate of $3.43."

InvestingPro Insights

As Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) forges ahead with its bold strategy in the semiconductor industry, real-time data from InvestingPro provides a nuanced view of the company's financial health and market position. Intel's market capitalization stands at a robust $185.1 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the market.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, including artificial intelligence chips, for the first time in a filing with the Securities and Exchange commission late Wednesday.

The Santa Clara, California-based company said that China's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence such as graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs) and networking chips. The company also identified Huawei as a cloud service company designing its own hardware and software to improve AI computing.

Nvidia declined to comment on Thursday.

Huawei developed the Ascend series of chips as a rival to Nvidia's line of AI chips. The Chinese company's main product, the 910B chip, is its main rival to Nvidia's A100 chip, which launched roughly three years ago.

Analysts have estimated China's AI chip market to be worth $7 billion.

Last year, Reuters reported that Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ: ) placed a chip order with Huawei ahead of widely anticipated new rules by the U.S. government tightened restrictions on advanced AI chips exported to China.

Other rivals pointed out by Nvidia include Intel (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ). The chip company also identified several large cloud computing companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: )

Nvidia shares surged 14% in early afternoon trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that topped consensus estimates as strong demand for AI continues."

By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney

(Reuters) -Intel said on Wednesday that Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) plans to use its services to manufacture a custom computing chip and that the company expects to beat an internal deadline of 2025 to overtake its biggest rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, in advanced chip manufacturing.

The chipmaker also gave new details on how it plans to maintain a lead over TSMC into 2026 and beyond.

Intel (NASDAQ: ) made the disclosures at an event in San Jose, California, at the first technology conference for Intel Foundry, the contract manufacturing operation it established to compete with TSMC.

Intel says it plans to retake the mantle of making the world's fastest chips from TSMC later this year with what it calls Intel 18A manufacturing technology and extend that lead into 2026 with new technology called Intel 14A.

It said Microsoft will use its 18A technology to make an undisclosed chip and that it now expects $15 billion of foundry orders, up from the $10 billion that the company had earlier told investors to expect.

The news of 14A technology is the first time that the Silicon Valley company has given details of its plans beyond the 2025. That is the deadline that Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, had set to regain the chipmaking crown when he took the reins three years ago.

For decades, Intel made chips only for itself and used its lead in manufacturing to create a cycle in which it made chips with industry-leading performance and charged a premium for them. Those margins, in turn, helped fund manufacturing advances. But when Intel lost its manufacturing lead, its chips became less competitive and margins slipped, sapping the source funding for a manufacturing rebound.

Now, Intel is counting on potentially billions of dollars in U.S. government subsidies and business from outside customers to help it get back on track.

It is hoping some customers will be enticed by its long history of operating cutting-edge factories on multiple continents, especially those with concerns about TSMC's practice of keeping its most advanced factories clustered in Taiwan.

""It's a sales pitch that's resonating right now. People want that,"" Stu Pann, the executive overseeing Intel Foundry, said of the company's geographic diversity.

Intel says it has four ""large"" customers signed up for its 18A manufacturing technology but has yet to name them. It is unclear whether Microsoft is among those financially important customers.

Intel said on Wednesday it was partnering with Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) to make it easier to make chips with Arm technologies in its factories. Intel also said it will work with the University of California Berkeley and the University of Michigan to allow students to access its 18A manufacturing technology.

Intel also has a special technology that analysts say will be useful for speeding up power-hungry artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), the leader in the AI chip market, has said it is evaluating Intel's manufacturing technology, but the two companies have not announced a deal.

Intel's effort to lure in outside customers ""is the key to the turnaround story,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies.

""Unfortunately, it's an unanswered question, because this is a two-to-three-year journey before we have any inkling of knowing that this is working."""

In total, across wafer and advanced packaging, Intel Foundry’s expected lifetime deal value is greater than $15 billion.

IP and EDA Vendors Declare Readiness for Intel Process and Packaging Designs

Intellectual property and electronic design automation (EDA) partners Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens, Ansys, Lorentz and Keysight disclosed tool qualification and IP readiness to enable foundry customers to accelerate advanced chip designs on Intel 18A, which offers the foundry industry’s first backside power solution. These companies also affirmed EDA and IP enablement across Intel node families.

At the same time, several vendors announced plans to collaborate on assembly technology and design flows for Intel’s embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMIB) 2.5D packaging technology. These EDA solutions will ensure faster development and delivery of advanced packaging solutions for foundry customers.

Intel also unveiled an ""Emerging Business Initiative"" that showcases a collaboration with Arm to provide cutting-edge foundry services for Arm-based system-on-chips (SoCs). This initiative presents an important opportunity for Arm and Intel to support startups in developing Arm-based technology and offering essential IP, manufacturing support and financial assistance to foster innovation and growth.

Systems Approach Differentiates Intel Foundry in the AI Era

Intel’s systems foundry approach offers full-stack optimization from the factory network to software. Intel and its ecosystem empower customers to innovate across the entire system through continuous technology improvements, reference designs and new standards.

Stuart Pann, senior vice president of Intel Foundry at Intel said, “We are offering a world-class foundry, delivered from a resilient, more sustainable and secure source of supply, and complemented by unparalleled systems of chips capabilities. Bringing these strengths together gives customers everything they need to engineer and deliver solutions for the most demanding applications.”

Global, Resilient, More Sustainable and Trusted Systems Foundry

Resilient supply chains must also be increasingly sustainable, and today Intel shared its goal of becoming the industry’s most sustainable foundry. In 2023, preliminary estimates show that Intel used 99% renewable electricity in its factories worldwide. Today, the company redoubled its commitment to achieving 100% renewable electricity worldwide, net-positive water and zero waste to landfills by 2030. Intel also reinforced its commitment to net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2040 and net-zero upstream Scope 3 emissions by 2050.

(Reuters) - Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday released a new set of blueprints for making chips that it says could cut the time required to develop data center processors to less than a year.

Arm, whose underlying technology is widely used in the semiconductor industry and powers virtually every smartphone in the world, has been working to take market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) in the market for data central processors, or CPUs.

Arm, which is majority owned by Japan's SoftBank (TYO: ) Group, argues that its CPUs will become the preferred pairing with Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips in many artificial intelligence data centers, which has helped drive Arm's shares up more than 60% this year.

Arm's technology for creating data center processors is already in use by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Ampere Computing, which supplies chips to Oracle (NYSE: ). Arm on Wednesday announced a new generation of designs for the computing ""cores"" - the most central part of a data center chip.

But the larger announcement was that the cores will be offered as part of what Arm calls a ""compute subsystem."" That offering ties together the cores with other offerings from Arm into something closer to a complete chip design. Arm argues that customers can use it to go from an initial idea to a test chip in less than a year.

That's about half the time of a traditional two-year chip development cycle. Arm said that Microsoft already used the subsystem technology to design its ""Cobalt"" chip announced last year.

""That's a huge deal,"" Ryan Shrout of chip research firm Shrout Research said of cutting down development time.

Shrout said that one of the biggest challenges for traditional chip firms like Intel and AMD was keeping a steady design cadence. Now, Arm is offering to do that work for anyone willing to pay for its blueprints, even if they aren't a traditional chip company.

""It's one of the reasons why you're seeing Amazon, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft start to build their own platforms and not just build them once, but iterate on them. They're coming out with new generations relatively quickly,"" Shrout said."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - A global consortium of semiconductor industry groups has asked India to reconsider its plan to push for duties on cross-border digital e-commerce and data transfers at an upcoming global trade meeting, warning that India's stance will stifle its own chip design industry.

Ministers from across the globe are convening for a World Trade Organization meeting in Abu Dhabi early next week to try to discuss several trade-related issues, including extending a moratorium in place since 1998 on applying duties on electronic transmissions.

Developing nations like India, South Africa and Indonesia are set to oppose efforts by U.S. and Europe to extend the moratorium. If no agreement is made, the moratorium would expire this year.

The moratorium collapse would mean tariffs on digital e-commerce and an innumerable number of transfers of chip design data across countries, raising costs and worsening chip shortages, the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) wrote to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

The chips sector is a key plank of Modi's agenda to push India's economic growth, with a $10 billion incentive package in place to boost the Industry.

Duties on data transfers would "" also impede India's efforts to advance its semiconductor industry and attract semiconductor investment, especially as more than 20% of the world's semiconductor design workforce is based in India,"" the group wrote in the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters.

The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WSC comprises of chip industry associations in regions like the U.S. and China, which represent chip stalwarts such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

New Delhi has said that physical goods like books and videos, once governed by traditional tariff rules, were now available as digital services and should be subject to duties. Developing nations are facing massive loss in potential revenue with such imports from developed countries on the rise, India maintains.

WSC in its letter also urged India to work toward a WTO agreement to permanently prohibit countries from subjecting cross-border data and digital tools to customs duties and procedures.

India's support to renewing the moratorium will ""send a strong signal to semiconductor companies that India is an investment friendly environment,"" the group wrote."

Jeff Bezos, Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and several other leading technology companies are investing in Figure AI Inc., a startup focused on developing human-like robots, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

The company, which also enjoys backing from OpenAI and Microsoft Corp . (NASDAQ: ), is in the process of raising approximately $675 million in a funding round, giving it a pre-money valuation of approximately $2 billion.

Bezos, through Explore Investments LLC, is contributing $100 million, with Microsoft adding $95 million. Nvidia and an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). affiliate fund are each investing $50 million.

This investment reflects the technology sector's growing interest in robots as a way to apply advanced AI in practical settings. Figure AI is reportedly working on Figure 01, a robot designed to mimic human appearance and movement, aiming to undertake hazardous tasks and address labor shortages.

The round also sees contributions from Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ).’s venture arm with $25 million, LG Innotek with $8.5 million, and Samsung’s investment group with $5 million. Additional support comes from venture firms Parkway Venture Capital and Align Ventures, contributing $100 million and $90 million, respectively.

OpenAI, which previously explored an acquisition of Figure, is participating with a $5 million investment.

The interest from such significant players has spurred further investment, pushing the total amount raised notably above the $500 million that Figure initially targeted.

The latest funding round comes after the robot maker secured $70 million last May, in a round led by Parkway Venture Capital."

LUNR +15.82% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Investing.com-- Shares of aerospace firm Intuitive Machines Inc (NASDAQ: ) rose sharply in after-hours trading on Thursday after the firm’s “Odysseus” lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon.

Shares of the firm jumped 50% to $12.41 by 19:27 ET (00:27 GMT). They had lost about 11% during the session on Thursday. Shares had also rallied some 75% since last week's launch of the Odysseus mission, called IM-1.

The firm’s Nova-C cargo lander, named “Odysseus” after the hero from Greek mythology, became the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the moon since 1972. Intuitive is also the first private firm to ever achieve such a feat, given that all past lunar landings were done by government firms, specifically the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Intuitive has several contracts with the government agency, with Thursday’s landing also being done in collaboration with the space agency. NASA said the landing was part of its Artemis project to land the first woman and person of color on the moon.

But despite Thursday’s surge, Intuitive’s stock still remained well below a one-year high hit earlier during the session.

The stock also remained well below record highs hit in February 2023, after a joint venture between Intuitive and engineering firm KBR Inc (NYSE: ) was was awarded a $719 million contract to support NASA’s Joint Polar Satellite System."

Investing.com-- The Dow and S&P 500 notched a record close Friday, even as the rally in Nvidia cooled to blunt the broader tech sector's swashbuckling gains amid waning optimism for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.

By 16:00 ET (21:40 GMT), the closed 62 points, or 0.2%, eked out gains to close at a fresh record of 5,088.85, while fell 0.3%. The three major averages closed up for the week, rising more than 1%.

Nvidia briefly joins $2 trillion club as climb continues

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) gave up the bulk of its gains to close just above the flatline after briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time, having added $277 billion in stock market value the previous day, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings saw investors largely trade past warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates will stay higher for longer- a notion that was further reinforced by stronger-than-expected jobless claims data.

The gains in Nvidia helped keep losses in the broader semiconductor index in check after Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: ) gave up some gains from a day earlier.

Fed speak continues to weigh on rate-cut bets

Investors continued to rein in their expectations for aggressive rate cuts, following fresh remarks from Federal Reserve officials that point to a prolonged higher-for-longer interest-rate regime.

Federal Reserve Board Governor said on Thursday that he was in ""no rush"" to lower rates. A slew of Fed members have previously echoed this notion, citing fears of sticky inflation and strength in the labor market.

Traders are now expecting the first rate cut in June rather than May, with just four rate cuts expected, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that they no longer think the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to slash interest rates at its policy meeting in May following Waller's comments, now expecting the Fed to roll out its first 25 basis-point cut in June.

By Akash Sriram and Abhirup Roy

(Reuters) -Electric vehicle startups Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on Wednesday as persistently high borrowing costs keep consumers from buying relatively pricier battery-powered cars.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ).com-backed Rivian also said it would cut its workforce by 10%.

Shares in Rivian and Lucid plummeted 15% and 8% respectively after the announcements - the latest signs of a slowdown in EV demand flagged by automakers including Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ) and market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ). The plateauing demand sparked a price war last year as companies drained margins to woo customers.

Rivian, the maker of R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs, is planning a weeks-long production shut down this year to upgrade its production line to improve efficiency and cut costs.

As a result, Rivian said it expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, well below estimates of 81,700 units, according to eight analysts polled by Visible Alpha. It produced 57,232 vehicles last year.

""There is a host of macro level challenges,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters, adding that high interest rates and geopolitical risks were making consumers more conscious and price sensitive.

After shying away from cutting the price of its vehicles last year, Rivian this month introduced lower-range options for its existing cars that are $3,100 cheaper.

Still, Rivian said it expects deliveries in the current quarter to be 10-15% lower than the already weak fourth quarter and that its order book had reduced due to factors including cancellations.

Rivian has been focusing on reducing its cash burn by re-negotiating supply contracts and building some components in house. Along with the cost benefits from the production line upgrade, the company said it expects margins to improve by the end of the year.

""A lot is riding on"" the company's smaller and cheaper R2 SUV that is set to be unveiled next month, Vitaly Golomb, a Rivian investor and an investment banker, told Reuters. Production is scheduled to start in 2026.

Like Rivian, Lucid is planning to start producing a mid-size car late in 2026 to attract a broader customer base, after its Gravity SUV goes into production later this year.

""With that we're going to target a $50,000 price point,"" Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said in an interview.

""Right now, we're competing with Mercedes and Porsche. When that comes out, we're going after Tesla Model Y and Model 3,"" he said, adding that he expects Lucid's total addressable market to increase 20 times.

Lucid, which has been slashing prices of its Air luxury electric sedans, also forecast production for 2024 that was much lower than Wall Street's expectations.

It expects to make 9,000 units this year, up from 8,428 vehicles in 2023. Wall Street estimated 22,594 units, according to five analysts polled by Visible Alpha."

On Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald adjusted its stance on Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ), shifting from a Neutral to an Underweight rating, accompanied by a reduction in the price target from $6.00 to $4.00. The revision stems from a series of challenges faced by the electric vehicle manufacturer, including high negative gross margins, a downward revision in the annual production outlook, and waning demand.

The firm has also revised its revenue forecasts for the fiscal years 2024 and 2025 to approximately $724.2 million and $1,651.2 million, respectively. This marks a significant decrease from the prior estimates of $1,654.6 million for FY24 and $5,076.9 million for FY25. The adjustments were influenced by lowered expectations for vehicle production and deliveries as well as anticipated average selling prices (ASPs).

The production estimates for Lucid vehicles have been scaled back to 9,500 units for the year 2024, a reduction from the previously projected 15,000 units. For 2025, the production forecast has been adjusted to 20,000 vehicles, down from an initial estimate of approximately 38,000 units. In an effort to stay competitive within the industry, Lucid has been lowering its vehicle prices, leading to a new blended ASP estimate of around $88,000 for FY24.

Cantor Fitzgerald's price target of $4 is the result of a bottom-up 10-year discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, assuming an 11% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and a terminal value based on a 2% long-term growth rate. The firm also highlighted key risks that could impact Lucid's performance, including ongoing supply chain disruptions, slower-than-anticipated customer demand, manufacturing hurdles, and intense competition in the market.

A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and information regarding reconciliation of our GAAP versus non-GAAP results is available in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon as well as in our investor deck. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lucid's CEO and CTO, Peter Rawlinson. Peter, please go ahead.

Peter Rawlinson: Thank you, Maynard, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. During the first 3 years of production of Lucid Air, we've garnered significant industry accolades, including Car and Driver 10 Best List for 2024, The 2023 World Luxury Car of the Year and the 2022 Motor Trend Car of the Year. I can't think of any other company that has gotten this far this fast. Our superior technology, design and performance has repeatedly been recognized. We've proved our technology prowess with Lucid Air. And not only did we pioneer the concept of efficient range through our technology, we also grew our lead with 4.74 miles of range per kilowatt hour for the Air Pure real wheel drive. The technology gap between Lucid and others is growing, not shrinking. We also launched the Lucid Air Sapphire, the first supersport EV Sudan as a halo product to showcase the potency of our technology. Not just the most powerful production Sudan ever, it has also been recognized as a great all-around driving car with exceptional handling and driving dynamics. Its exceptional 427 miles of EPA estimated range and fast charging truly completes the package. And now we're embarking upon our next and most transformational phase of our development with the expansion of our vehicle lineup. The expansion of Lucid's total addressable market starts right now with the Air Pure rear wheel drive grows with Gravity and broadens with the forthcoming midsized platform. We unveiled the Lucid Gravity at the LA Auto Show in November to tremendous early reviews. I am confident that the Lucid Gravity will redefine the electric SUV segment with incredible range, superior efficiency, fast charging speed and interior space that you have to see to believe. It will be unlike anything in its class, and it will be massive for Lucid. And for those who might be in Geneva, Switzerland next week, we welcome you to come and see us at the Geneva International Motor Show, where we will introduce the Gravity to the European market. Now turning to sales and marketing. In 2023, we increased our brand awareness. And of greater significance our awareness among EV purchasing tenders increased substantially from the beginning of the year. And this gives us confidence that our sales and marketing initiatives are making solid progress. And we'll continue to take a science-based, data-driven analytical approach to our marketing but are also adding new initiatives. For example, our recent Saks Fifth Avenue partnership will allow us to leverage Saks luxury brand and ecosystem to generate awareness, leads and sales. Select locations will have test drive vehicles, further expanding our reach in locations which are not currently present with the studio. Of particular significance has been our recent Air Pure Stealth initiative launched just last week. We have now realized a starting price point for the Lucid Air range of $69,900. Yes, that's right. The finest production EV in the world now starts at under $70,000. This effectively extends the scope of the Lucid Air range into a new total addressable market segment. In fact, we're already seeing extremely promising results from this. Moreover, this is commensurate with our long-term strategy to make progressively more affordable vehicles. This remarkable value proposition has in large part been made possible by our world-leading technology. Because [indiscernible] enables our cars to go further with less batteries, the Air Pure rear wheel drive is able to achieve an EPA estimated range of 419 miles [indiscernible] further than the competition. But more significantly, it achieves this with a battery pack size of just 88-kilowatt hours. And since the cost of an EV is dominated by the cost of the battery pack, this technical advantage translates directly to profound commercial advantage. Now I believe it's important that the full impact of this is fully comprehended. The EPA testing procedure has recently been revised, and it's become more stringent. So Air Pure rear wheel drive is able to achieve a landmark miles of range per kilowatt hour of battery capacity, and that's with new EPA ratings. So whilst we are currently witnessing other EV brands registering reductions in their respective range ratings, Lucid is forging ahead, growing and building upon our technology advantage, and with it, I believe our future commercial advantage. But I want to be clear, I'm also critically focused upon cost. It's not well understood that we designed and developed our technology for true mass manufacturability at scale. And we have more coming. We have significant advancements that I believe can drive costs down further. Technology is not only about creating incredible products. It's also about innovation to improve costs. And I've never been more pumped about what's coming, what's yet to come from our technology roadmap. We are resolutely focused upon cost whilst continuing to prudently invest for the future. Through 2023, we dramatically expanded our advanced manufacturing plant in Arizona, which we call AMP (OTC: ) 1, and that was in preparation for Gravity. We built a state-of-the-art a general assembly line that is capable of assembling both Gravity and Air on the same line. And we'll continue to vertically integrate where it makes the most sense in areas of stamping, , our paint shop expansion and the new powertrain facility at AMP 1. We built the first ever car manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia for semi knockdown kits. This year we also broke ground for the manufacturing of the completely built-up cars there. These are critical long-term investments that are reflected in our cost of goods sold. Now the imagery in our earnings presentation, I hope gives you some sense of the scope and scale of what we're doing. When you see it in person and not the different shots in the factory, you truly start to understand how we're building a state-of-the-art factory for the future. In fact, in January of this year, we have more than 100 guests representing over 60 strategic suppliers for Gravity, Air and for potentially midsize come to our factory. The feedback and support from our suppliers was extraordinary. They highlighted our best-in-class and advanced technology and continued investment in our production facilities, which provide a material signal of our long-term commitment. My key message to them was one of growth, the critical need for obsessed partners, focused upon excellence and the importance of driving this journey together. So I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of them. Now on the R&D side, we continue to invest for future supremacy, and I'm incredibly excited about our road map, both from an innovation and from a cost perspective. In 2023, we also raised $3 billion, including unparalleled support of $1.8 billion in equity funding from our largest shareholder, the PIF. Now Gagan will talk about liquidity in further detail. We formed our technology licensing and access business through our first such deal with Aston Martin, and we're actively exploring additional and even broader technology and supply agreements. We also have sales to a rental car company, and we're very pleased with early results. Lucid's range and efficiency are perfectly suited for fleets. And in fact, we saw new incremental orders from that rental car company due to demand. Of course, we haven't yet scaled this business. We're taking a methodical approach, which is prudent, and we're pleased with what we're seeing thus far. This is yet another tool to help grow our brand awareness and allow potential customers experience the car. 2023 was also a year where we made significant progress with our in-house software capabilities. Software is more than just the user interface. We have some of the best software engineers in the world, working on everything from user interface to new features, to powertrain to infrastructure. In fact, we developed and have been transitioning to our own in-house over-the-air software infrastructure. This not only helps our OTA functionality but it's also a source of cost savings. Now building an OTA software as a service platform is no small feat. One that I believe most other car companies would simply not be able to do. And it's another example of technology aiding costs. And of course, this is a platform that we could potentially monetize in the future. Now I want to be transparent as well. We also had some challenges. Firstly, the macroeconomic and higher interest rate environment impacted mainly in this market. And in the new markets to us, there's been some learning. For example, in Saudi Arabia, we learned that there are different market dynamics and intricacy is unique to that market. And so we have to scale that business differently for growth. But we've addressed the pain points. We're scaling up and expect good growth in the region this year. Now we've also faced some technical challenges with commencing production of the rear wheel drive Pure in the fourth quarter. This is normal when doing something so advanced and so efficient. As I said, a landmark achievement with a 4.74 miles of range per kilowatt hour. This is our most accessible car, and we had challenges ramping it up. But I'm delighted to say that we've now overcome these challenges and are now fully ramped in pure production. So as we start 2024, I'm very excited about the year ahead and beyond. We made focused improvements to further enhance our customer journey. For example, the Lucid financial services team has been working to enhance and to simplify the customer financing experience, significantly reducing the customer cycle time to finance vehicles. And we are also in the midst of implementing a new technology platform. Combined with the rollout of our accelerated delivery pilots, we were able to significantly improve the cycle times from order to delivery, improve customer satisfaction and, in some cases, increase orders. In one instance, we were able to get a customer through their purchase journey from the time they place the order to the time they completed delivery walk out in only just about 3 hours. Now this new process has been live for select markets since Q4 and for new loans and is expected to go live for all lease and other loan markets by the end of Q1 of this year. You'll see us roll these out to more locations throughout 2024. So our total addressable market triples by doing what we always intended to do, making the Air progressively more affordable and now starting at under $70,000. A technical achievement in getting an 88-kilowatt hour battery pack in the Pure allows us to cut out battery costs but still provide an EPA estimated range of 419 miles even based upon the new and more stringent EPA testing. And Gravity will further expand our total addressable market from 2023 by more than 6x. The Gravity is scheduled for start of production late this year and numerous prototypes are already driving around. In fact, we just built more than 40 prototypes to date. You just have to see to believe it, the interior space and the sheer practicality is what every family has been craving, made only possible by our technology and design. And I'm exceptionally encouraged by the early feedback and interest. We saw more than fourfold increase in daily gravity interest sign-ups following the L.A. Auto Show unveil. And the start of production for more affordable, high-volume midsized car is scheduled for late 2026. We'll continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with the midsized platform and the next-gen powertrain technology. And this will expand our market opportunity from 2023 to nearly 20x. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to invest in our future with further vertical integration with stamping, with for Gravity with paint shop expansion and powertrain at AMP 1, an important part of our longer-term cost and quality strategy. I want also to touch on the broader market landscape and what seems to be a shift in emphasis from EVs. We have the utmost confidence in the future growth of the EV market. Environmental sustainability, energy storage improvements, regulatory forces and sheer performance superiority over internal combustion engine vehicles will drive the eventual march to an EV dominated automotive market. Emission standards are getting more stringent, and you've heard me say this many times. This truly is a technology race. But doing world-leading EV technology isn't easy and not everyone can do it. And I believe that is becoming better understood now. As others are pulling back on EVs, we are here ready to help. We've talked about our willingness to work with other OEMs, and we've signed our first technology access deal with Aston Martin. And we continue to receive incremental interest from larger OEMs and others in the automotive space as well as in adjacent markets for our advanced technology. In the automotive vertical, this is not only for electric vehicles, but we are also seeing interest in our technology for use in hybrid electric vehicles. There's nothing to announce yet today in terms of the deal, but we're really encouraged by the level of interest. And we're open to it because we think it's critically important for the planet. Sustainability is at the core of who we are. It's ingrained in our purpose and our products, and we are a technology innovation company. EVs are just the start, but we also believe in the importance of accountability and transparency, which is why I'm so proud to say that we published our very first sustainability report just last week. We have more to come in 2024 with the expansion of our total addressable market opportunity with Air Pure and Gravity, further software enhancements and significant announcements, the opening of Gravity orders, the start of Gravity test drives and, of course, start of production of Gravity later this year. Now we've come a long way, and we're here to do much more. We are here to stay. We have a clear and determined strategy for growth while having a laser focus upon costs. So I'd like to close by saying thank you to our suppliers, to our partners, and to our most important asset, our employees. We've overcome significant challenges and I can't think of any other people I would rather be with on this journey than the people here at Lucid. You are the core of our successes. And we are embarking upon our next transformational phase of the Lucid story, and so I've never been more excited about the future. And with that, I'd like to introduce Gagan Dhingra, who has stepped into the role of our interim CFO, Gagan, please provide an update on our financials.

Gagan Dhingra: Thank you, Peter, and thank you to those who are taking the time to join us today. Before I get to my prepared remarks, I would also like to start by thanking the entire Lucid team. Over the past few months, I have spent even more time working closely with all the different parts of the organization. I am incredibly impressed by your perseverance, resourcefulness and teamwork. The successes we have been able to achieve is in no small part due to all of you. Turning to the business. In 2023, we made headway with our cost optimization programs, the key strategic priority for the company. We found success in areas, including freight, logistics, overhead and bill of materials. For example, we activated logistics as a part of the Phase II build-out of our Arizona factory, AMP 1, allowing us to bring the vast majority of vehicle components under the same roof as general assembly. This enabled us to realize savings from the reduction in overhead, transportation and complexity as well as better efficiency. From an inventory perspective, we drew down raw material inventory levels by high teens percent from the start of Q4 through material planning and inventory management improvements. Improvements in focus accuracy, in particular, allowed us to reduce inventory resulted in savings related to logistics and material handling labor, equipment rentals and storage cost. We also experienced a significant reduction in freight from more efficient transportation and storage planning. For vehicle direct costs, we implemented a number of initiatives that resulted in certain bill of materials cost savings, some of which is directly related to our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint. We have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold as well as operating expenses that we will look to operationalize over the course of 2024. Turning to our 2023 and fourth quarter financial results. We produced 8,428 vehicles in 2023, up 17% year-over-year and at the higher end of the 8,000 to 8,500 guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call. During the fourth quarter, we produced 2,390 vehicles, up 54% sequentially. In 2023, we delivered 6,001 vehicles up 37% year-over-year and in the fourth quarter, delivered 1,734 vehicles, up 19% sequentially. We expected to deliver more vehicles in Saudi Arabia in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, the ramp-up was taking longer than we expected. However, we believe we now have the right infrastructure and processes built out. Turning to the P&L. For Q4, revenue was $157.2 million, up 14% sequentially, driven primarily by higher deliveries. Cost of revenue in Q4 was $410 million. I want to make sure this is well understood. You cannot take this line item and divide it by the number of cars delivered to get the initial cost of making each vehicle. This is because our lower of cost or net eligible value, or LCNRV, also takes into account losses on raw materials and from purchase commitments. We have LCNRV adjustments, which write down certain inventory value to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future cost necessary to get the inventory ready for the ultimate sale. And we also record losses on firm purchase commitments. In addition, as we ramp up production, we expect the overhead per vehicle to improve. Our gross margin improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis primarily due to lower impairment charges in Q4 related to LCNRV. This amount was approximately $174.1 million, a 24.6% reduction from Q3. Although there are many controllable and uncontrollable variables that can affect gross margin, so we don't typically provide specific gross margin guidance, I wanted to provide some directional color to aid in your modeling. Looking forward to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate improvements to gross margin despite the price adjustments in the quarter for Pure and Tooling. The improvements are expected to be driven primarily by projected reductions in impairments. As we move into the back half of the year, we expect to build inventory of Gravity components ahead of start of production, and so expect an increase in LCNRV impairments from an accounting standpoint that will affect gross margin. As I noted earlier, we have identified additional opportunities in cost of goods sold and we'll continue to focus on implementation and further areas for cost out. Now moving to operating expenses. R&D expense in Q4 totaled approximately $243 million up 5.3% sequentially due largely to higher personnel-related expenses. We believe our R&D investment into technology garners a strong return as the technology is not only used in our own vehicles but can also be leveraged as an additional revenue stream through strategic technology deals such as the one with Aston Martin. SG&A expense in Q4 was approximately $241 million, up from $189.7 million in Q3. The sequential increase was primarily related to an increase in sales and marketing spend, which is consistent with what we talked about in prior quarters related to putting more energy behind our science-based data-driven sales and marketing initiatives, professional services and personnel-related expenses related to largely geographic expansion. We ended the fourth quarter with 45 studio and service centers, excluding our temporary and satellite service centers flat from Q3. On the service side, we ended Q4 with 47 mobile vans in the fleet and 79 nationwide shops. We plan to continue to strategically expand our studio and service center footprint as well as satellite service centers, which will cost effectively provide additional locations for Lucid customers. Although we don't provide specific guidance on operating expenses, I did want to provide some broader directional color. Looking into 2024 we expect operating expenses to be up year-over-year on an absolute basis, but expect it to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Our stock-based compensation in the quarter was $63.9 million. Total other income was $83.1 million, down from $122.3 million in Q3. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower noncash benefit of $25.3 million related to the change in fair value of our common stock warrant liability down from $60.3 million in Q3. As a reminder, this noncash impact can be influenced quarter-to-quarter by a number of factors with one of the larger factors being Lucid shared price at the end of the quarter. We also recognized $6 million in unrealized gains related to the Aston Martin stock we received in Q4 as a part of our strategic technology management. In Q4, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA loss of $604.6 million, a slight improvement from $624.1 million in Q3. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments, with total liquidity of approximately $4.78 billion. Note, this excludes the $81.5 million in value of the Aston Martin shares as of December 31. We have been able to consistently sustain a strong balance sheet over time. And as we have done for the last couple of years, we will continue to be opportunistic in exploring and diversifying access to financing sources. Accounts receivable increased to $51.8 million in the fourth quarter, up sequentially from $23.4 million in the third quarter. The increase was primarily due to vehicle sales related to EV purchase agreements with the government of Saudi Arabia, and you can expect that this mix could result in fluctuations on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Turning to inventory. Total inventory decreased 12.9% sequentially primarily due to raw material drawdown. We continue to see a box to a significant reduction in raw material days of inventory on hand as we work towards greater predictability in the transportation channel and refine our inventory management processes and systems. Capital expenditures for 2023 was $910.6 million, slightly below the $1 billion to $1.1 billion range we guided to on our third quarter earnings conference call. The lower CapEx was primarily related to developed projects into 2024. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $272.6 million, up from $192.5 million in Q3. Moving to the outlook for 2024. We forecast production of approximately 9,000 vehicles in 2024, and we'll continue to prudently manage and adjust our production to meet our sales and delivery needs. Although we don't typically provide quarterly forecasts, I would remind you that the North American market is typically down sequentially in the first quarter. However, we expect to deliver vehicles in Saudi Arabia that we were not able to deliver in fourth quarter of 2023. With regard to our liquidity position, we ended the quarter with total liquidity of approximately $4.78 billion. We expect this will give us runway through the start of production of Gravity and at least into 2025. Moving to CapEx. Our focus is increasing investments in our future growth initiatives, and we expect capital expenditures for 2024 to be approximately $1.5 billion, reflecting certain defers in our capital outlay, M2 expansion for completely built up unit which we broke out last month. The completion of the AMP 1 Phase II expansion for stamping, paint shop, powertrain on-premise and Gravity body in . From a product perspective, we have scheduled for Gravity starter production in late 2024, and start of production of our high-volume midsized platform is scheduled for late 2026. In closing, I would like to echo Peter's excitement as we enter the next transformation phase of the Lucid. We gained market share in 2023 and outpaced our overall addressable market despite the challenging macro environment, and I'm excited about the significant expansion of our total addressable market opportunity with the Pure, Gravity and the upcoming midsized platform. We are confident in the growth of the EV market and that we have the right technology, people and product lineup to succeed. With that, let me turn it back to Maynard to get to your questions, Maynard.

A - Maynard Um: Thanks, Gagan. We'll now start the Q&A portion of the call. As we typically do, we'll start with the saved retail questions. The first question is from Ed. Where are you at on production and delivery of Saudi orders?

Peter Rawlinson: Well, last year, we made history in Saudi Arabia with the opening of the country's first ever manufacturing facility. In its first phase, the factory has a capacity to assemble just 5,000 Lucid vehicles a year, and operations have been well underway. Last month, actually, we broke ground on the factory for completely built up or CBU cars and these are critical investments into our future. And we're grateful for all the support from the government and from our partners.

Gagan Dhingra: With regard to deliveries, we started deliveries to the Ministry of Finance last year. Under the terms of the agreement, the government has committed to purchase 50,000 vehicles with an option to purchase additional 50,000 over a 10-year time frame. This includes the Lucid Air as well as future models such as the Gravity and midsized platform. As I said in the opening remarks, the ramp was taking longer. We now have the infrastructure built out and have the right processes, we are scaling and expect good growth in 2024.

Maynard Um: Our next question is from Paul. Do you plan to reduce time to market for new products? Gravity has delayed 1 year. Third model is now mooted as mid- to late decade to the 2025. And as shareholders were losing value due to failures and delays, what happened to the all-star team and proven track record?

Peter Rawlinson: Yes. That's a good point actually. I mean what we saw unprecedented external forces that impacted us with COVID and the global supply chain disruption. And that impacted many in the industry, not just Lucid. But I would say this. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) is the benchmark for engineering speed. If you look at the time taken between the start of production of Tesla Model S and X, it was just a bit over 3 years. If you look at where -- I mean we're scheduled for production for Gravity late this year, that's going to be a very similar time period between production of Air and Gravity. And that's despite it not being a derivative product there, a whole new platform. So I think that is a world-leading pace of engineering. And for a small team to get Gravity, a landmark product, a completely differentiated product in just over 3 years. Now midsize what we've done is define a schedule for it, we're scheduling for late '26. Very similar in time scale. It's right there. I think this is world-class execution, frankly.

Maynard Um: Thanks, Peter. We'll go to question 3. Are there any updates regarding future partnerships with Apple?

Peter Rawlinson: Well, as a general corporate policy, we don't talk about any particular companies, particularly as it relates to the future. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we have what I believe is the best tech history. We've seen increased interest from others, and we're very open to it because we think it's critically important for the planet. As I said before, it's super hard to do a good EV. It's relatively easy to make a bad EV and this growing realization just how hard it is to do a world-class EV.

Maynard Um: Next question is from Landon. When will Gravity reservations open? Is there a target date for first deliveries? We know what -- the target date for first deliveries.

Peter Rawlinson: Oh, yes, I'm hoping we'll deliver some Gravity vehicles later this year. But naturally, you should expect the bigger volume to be around 2025. But we know the excitement around gravity is palpable.

Maynard Um: Okay. And we'll take our last saved question from Daniel. Do you plan to take a salary cut to reduce losses or plan to buy back shares to improve stock health?

Peter Rawlinson: Well, many may not be aware of my founding role in this company as we know it today. I joined the company around 11 years ago, with a clear goal of making the very best electric vehicle and to drive a revolution towards sustainable transportation, which is going to benefit everyone in the planet. Around that, we would call [indiscernible]. And I guess we had around 19 employees. So in 2021, I received a onetime CEO stock grant, and this was solely determined and approved by the Board of Directors. And a significant portion of that vested due to the company achieving certain market capitalization milestones as we publicly disclosed in 2023. So I think there's a huge misperception that this onetime grant was received as a salary and somehow we replicate it as my salary in the future. In fact, in 2023, at my request, I did not receive a bonus for 2022, nor did I receive any further equity grants in '22 or '23. And I just want to assure you, my mission and my dedication is still unwavering. I have not sold a single share of stock in all this time, over 10 years, except what was absolutely necessary for tax purposes. And the company stock I received from the grant remains in the form of company stock. And so I am also directly tied, personally tied, directly and hugely to the company's performance as a key shareholder. And so I'm incentivized that way. My promise is to continue to work tirelessly, day and night, to drive brand awareness, to deliver more cars, to sign up more technology licensing and access agreements, to drive down costs and to bring the Gravity and midsized platform to market. We have an incredible team. We're driving forward, and I'm incredibly excited about our products and moreover, our future.

Gagan Dhingra: Regarding the second part of the question, we are investing in our future, but we are a growth company. We are also a technology company. and I believe our investments into areas such as our research and development is an advantage and give us the opportunity for higher returns than any other automotive company because we are monetizing the intellectual property through agreements such as the one with Aston Martin. When we feel we can't increase value from reinvesting back into the business, we would consider returning the cash to shareholders via a repurchase program. But we don't believe this would happen for quite some time.

Maynard Um: Okay, thanks. Towanda, can we turn it over to go to questions on the call, please?

Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.

John Murphy: Good morning, everybody -- good afternoon. Sorry, long day here. Peter, as you think about the gravity, it's really kind of showcasing your technology, not just on the powertrain but also in the body and structures of the vehicle, meaning just you have maximum material space for the footprint, is pretty impressive. As we think about the Gravity, it seems like it's going to be a game changer for you in the market. However, it does seem like the midsize platform may be even more important. As we think about the launch of these two programs late this year and then the midsize in 2026, in relative importance, which is more important for Lucid for mid- to long-term success? And how do you kind of gauge that relative size of importance to the company?

Peter Rawlinson: Thank you, John. I mean if you asked the question a year or 2 ago, people would question our technology. Today, it's given. The world's most -- we've got the very best technology. What we haven't got is scale and an economy of scale. And that is going to take place in 3 critical steps and the first step happened last week. We launched our Pure Stealth initiative. Lucid Air is now available at 69 -- from $69,900, the best EV on the planet at that price. That puts us into 3x the TAM, the total addressable market because now we go into E class Mercedes territory rather than S class So step one, Pure from $69,900, 3x the total addressable market. And then scheduled for production late this year, we have Gravity, the SUV. We're talking about 6x the TAM with Gravity. And then scheduled production late '26, the third step on this journey, midsize, 20x for TAM. It's all about scale. We've got the tech. The tech is designed for scale. It's about achieving scale and with that, we'll get the economies of scale and the margins and the profitability.

John Murphy: So ultimately, just to interpret that, I mean we're fighting to the position of getting to that even greater scale with the midsize, and that probably is sort of the fulcrum point and where you'll get to escape philosophy on profitability and cash flow. Is that a fair statement?

Peter Rawlinson: Today, we're competing with Mercedes and Porsche. With midsized, we compete directly with Tesla Model Y and Model 3. That's the best selling car in the world.

John Murphy: And then just one follow-up. You mentioned the potential for hybrid technology or joining obviously a nice engine to be part of a hybrid powertrain. I mean, one, what kind of discussions are going on there? And two, I mean in layman's terms, there's always these positions in electric motor to be put or placed in the ICE powertrain from P0 all the way back to P4 and various positions in the middle. As you kind of envision what you could bring to the table and the potential positioning or integration with an ICE engine to make a presumably pretty efficient powertrain for hybrid, where would you land in that positioning? And have you even thought of that at this point? So if you just talk about discussions that are going on and then sort of your thought process about how you would integrate into an ICE engine.

Peter Rawlinson: Yes. So we always envisaged a key pillar of our business being the technology licensing and supply where in we got the best technology, and that's recognized. Our arrangement with Aston Martin last year has triggered an increase in interest in our technology. we're also growing our own internal team so that we'll be able to not just be receiving passively inquiries but actually become a little bit more proactive in the future. Actually, the application for hybrid has come as an external inquiry. Because if you look at the core capabilities of our powertrain, the unique selling price of it -- proposition of it is its efficiency. Well, that applies equally to say, a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle or a gasoline electric hybrid and also it's compactness its power. And that is very relevant to the hybrid because in a hybrid, you've got to stuff in a gasoline engine and exhaust and all that stuff and that paraphernalia, and electric motors and battery. And it really becomes a packaging puzzle plus. And because we've got the most complex technology, that ideally lends itself to that. Now Lucid, it's not going to do hybrids. We're ready to bat for electric. We believe Pure is the solution. But certainly, the hybrid opportunity opens up a whole new market arena for our technology.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Dutton with Evercore ISI.

Douglas Dutton: Peter, so you mentioned a few manufacturing advancements coming to further drive down costs in 2024. I was just curious if you can quantify those or give us a couple of examples of initiatives that you have in progress right now to help on that cost side of the business.

Peter Rawlinson: Right. So we're really looking at further vertical integration, particularly in our factory in Arizona. We're bringing stamping in-house and that is going to be right alongside the new body shop for our Gravity. So we will reduce the operational cost, we will reduce OpEx. We'll reduce inbound logistics costs, we will actually reduce scrap as well. And there's an internal efficiency as well by having an integrated state-of-the-art hydraulic transfer stamping line with laser blanking facility fully integrated. Then we're actually moving our powertrain, which is already vertically integrated our world-class motors, inverters, drive units, all in-house at the moment. But that's in a separate factor up the road so we will save those logistics costs by actually putting them under the same roof as our main factory in Arizona, so we will save operational and will be efficiencies. The other thing we're integrating into that factory is logistics. And we've been able to draw down some of the cross stocks. I think all our cross stocks now virtually have been drawn down upon. So we've got inbound logistics cost savings. And then the other thing we're doing is we've really revised the organization so that quality reports directly into me. We're really driving down man hours per vehicle. But perhaps, Gagan, you could provide a little bit more color on some of the initiatives you're driving leading to drive down cost.

Gagan Dhingra: Yes. Thank you, Peter. So we have identified 3 initiatives, 1 scale. Scale will help us improve our margin. This is technology and volume rate. One, we took some initiatives in 2023, and we are seeing the results. But more importantly, we have identified additional opportunities that will look to operationalize in 2024. On operational efficiency, which is number three. And as Peter mentioned, we are looking multiple areas. One, freight, we made significant improvements in '23 and looking more in 2024. Logistics specifically as we move from our LOC warehouse to implement Phase 2 general assembly. This has really helped us in reducing the cost. This is a consistent exercise. And we are looking at this very carefully. This is my #1 goal, having the cost optimization. But again, it is not easy. We are looking at consistently. And also, we have initiated a team under me specifically looking each area very carefully looking at each dollar and bring the efficiencies. But as we grow, as we scale, it will bring us efficiencies. This is a technology and volume risk.

Peter Rawlinson: Yes. Scale is critical because to drive down the COGS, you've got that fixed cost component. And it's the amortization of the fixed cost and overhead depreciation per vehicle. So this is a -- this is the initiative to start at $69,000 is 3-step hitting our total addressable market, the scale will drive down the costs.

Douglas Dutton: Excellent. I appreciate all the detail there. That's really helpful. Just one quick one from me then. On Gravity, starting price of $80,000, obviously, not a ton of deliveries in 2024, but will that be similar to the strategy with the air where you're starting with the higher trims and then moving downstream. Is that the right way to think about pricing and the model pending '24 and going into '25?

Peter Rawlinson: Yes. we haven't disclosed that yet. I do think it's reasonable to assume Gravity is going to be in a similar competitive set as Air, it's going to be completing more in the Mercedes arena, we'll have to wait for midsize to come, which is scheduled for production late '26 to have a true Tesla Model Y Model 3 competitor. I mean, the key thing with Gravity is we're going to hit about 6x the TAM that's going to help us hugely with this economy of scale.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors, LLC.

Steven Fox: I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for the KSA market this year. You mentioned, first of all, that there was some unexpected nuances in ramping and I guess, production to during '23. So how do we think about how you benefit from that market and the growth during the year.

Gagan Dhingra: Yes. Thank you, Steven. We are limited to what we can say in general, and we do not specifically talk about any specific customer. But what we can say, and most of you are already aware that the government of Saudi Arabia has an initial commitment to purchase 50,000 vehicles with an option to purchase additional 50,000 vehicles. And as I said in the opening remarks, the ramp was taking longer than we expected. And we now have the right infrastructure and processes built out. There were significant administrative challenges. We have addressed most of the pain points we are scaling and expect good growth this year. And also note this government with Saudi Arabia also includes Air, Gravity and Midsize.

Steven Fox: That's helpful. And then just one clarification. You mentioned a lot of cost initiatives that are underway for '24. In '23, is there a way to quantify how the bill of materials came down or just directionally what it did versus '22?

Gagan Dhingra: Yes. We don't specifically guide but what I can say that our gross margin in Q4 improved compared to Q3. And also we don't provide a guidance, but I expect our gross margin will improve sequentially in Q1 next year. Having said that, our purchase of Gravity components ahead of start of production may have some impact on LCNRV as we progress. But as I said, the cost is a critical component. We are looking at it very carefully. We are very proud of what team has accomplished. Specifically related to the engineering team and supply chain team. They have done a tremendous job finding savings even through technology. So we are -- we have identified couple of areas, and we are looking very aggressively. And this is our #1 goal, looking at the cost optimization and [indiscernible].

Peter Rawlinson: I think the other thing is that I know I keep bringing on this point that is critical. It's a critical differentiator of us. Because we can go batteries, we can hit the biggest single cost item of ore on an EV, which is the cost of the battery. Some people are looking at these are so-called advance in technology and manufacturing, you might save $100 in a vehicle. You can say $,1000 potentially with having the ability to go further with less batteries. And we're seeing that playing out now with the Air Pure rear wheel drive. We've got more range than anyone else in that sector. And with just a 88-kilowatt hour battery pack, smaller pack, say, 12-kilowatt hours of pack has potentially thousands of bucks on bill of material.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tobias Beith with Redburn Electric.

Tobias Beith: I'd like to -- and maybe we'll start with my questions for Gagan. If I exclude the inventory write-down of the $172 million from COGS in the fourth quarter, it looks like unit COGS improved by about 20 percentage points sequentially. I was wondering what was it that drove the improvement? Was it the receipt of the $98 million government grant? Or is this accounted for elsewhere?

Gagan Dhingra: Yes, that's a good question. So first of all, grant doesn't play a role in the course as of today. What -- as I highlighted, we took a couple of initiatives in 2023. Freight like very important, we made significant savings but also, more importantly, our forecast accuracy of raw materials because today, the cost of goods sold is not only related to how many cars we sell. But is also related to what raw material inventory will have and how we utilize that. So the focus, accuracy, the freight opportunities in BAM really helped us out improve our gross margin in Q4.

Tobias Beith: Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And my second question relates to the Air and the Gravity. If I put aside the differences in the interior and exterior of the vehicles, are you able to share roughly what proportion of parts and components are shared I guess the fact that these vehicles are using different platforms may impact the variable cost down assumptions. It was previously communicated that both vehicles would leverage LEAP.

Peter Rawlinson: Okay. Let me cover that. If you look at the battery pack, which is the core, core part of the bill of materials of both vehicles, it is about 95% the same. It's -- they've both got the same number of modules, the same number of cells. They made exactly on the same line. It's just that the two of the top modules are a different location. We move them from underneath the rear seat in Air to underneath the front seat in Gravity. This has a transformative effect upon the nature of the vehicle, which in turn leads to a much bigger TAM. We can only capture that TAM, by having a degree of differentiation. Now if you look at the core powertrain, the drive units and the inverters they're very, very high proportion carryover, slightly different gear ratios because the wheels are bigger, and you need more tractability you have slightly lower gear ratios. Now the rest of the platform is very similar, which has meant that it saved on our R&D costs because we've got a learning and the process knowledge of how we rivet and glue the sheet stampings, the castings and the extrusions together. But there is a degree of difference in that platform, which I think makes a whole bunch of sense because it makes gravity a true SUV, not some sort of -- soft CUV derivative. And that means we go into a whole new TAM 6 times. We would not be able to capture that TAM. And also, you need to double the tools anyway because of the extra volume. So then we look at the upper body shell of the car, they're always going to be different anyway. So we're talking about a very slight increase in tooling costs. But in return for that, we truly enter a massively bigger term, 6x, and this is all about economy of scale. We've got the technology. It's designed for scale. We just haven't achieved that scale yet. And so therefore, it's not showing in our P&L.

Tobias Beith: Makes sense. All right. And if I could squeeze one last one in. 2 quarters ago, I asked about the steps required to move from beta prototyping of the gravity, which is then just started to series production. I was wondering if you could provide an update on the progress today.

Peter Rawlinson: So we're writing the thick of beta prototypes. In fact, both between betas and alphas, we've got more than 40 prototypes built, many of which are running around right now. We'll be finishing our run of beta prototypes over as we move now into the spring. And the next step will be to do our release candidates. That's our preproduction run through the summer in the factory and Arizona, which will lead to our scheduled start of production late this year.

Operator: Thank you. Due to the interest of time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Maynard for closing remarks.

Maynard Um: Thank you. This concludes Lucid's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you all for joining us today, and you may now disconnect.

By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) - A global slowdown in electric-vehicle demand is rippling through the industry, costing jobs and leading to changes in strategic plans, layoffs and production cuts, suggesting pain in the near term could slow the transition away from gasoline-powered combustion engines.

On Thursday, German luxury carmaker Mercedes toned down expectations on EV demand and said it will update its gasoline-powered engine vehicle lineup well into the next decade.

Mercedes delayed its goal to go all-electric by 2030. Instead, it now says it will retain combustion engines in at least half of its vehicles until then. Previously, it had hedged by saying consumer demand would dictate how soon it went all-electric.

""High interest rates, moderate oil prices, and range anxiety all have conspired against EV demand. The enthusiasm of early adopters of EVs wasn’t representative of the longer-term and broader demand for these vehicles,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, which does not own shares in any EV makers.

""We expected a reduction in demand and enthusiasm for the vehicles so we didn't find the valuations compelling,"" he added.

The pivot by Mercedes comes a day after EV startups Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) forecast 2024 production well below analysts' expectations and Rivian cut its workforce by 10%. That news caused shares of Rivian and Lucid to tumble on Thursday by 27.5% and 19.5%, respectively.

The pain follows last year's price war that drained margins and pressured many companies' already money-losing EV operations.

""There is a host of macro-level challenges,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that high interest rates and geopolitical risks were making consumers price-sensitive.

The situation was previously flagged by Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ) and market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ), where CEO Elon Musk's warning in January of the market leader's slowing pace of growth slashed $80 billion in market value in one day.

Prices for used EVs collapsed by 16.4% in January compared with a year ago, according to Manheim Used Vehicle Value index data. Even in China, the world's largest auto market where demand for EVs has been strong, new-energy vehicle sales fell 38% in January, the first monthly drop since August 2023.

That drumbeat of bad news even has the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden set to propose a softening of limits on tailpipe emissions designed to get more Americans into EVs, sources said.

Earlier this month, Volvo (OTC: ) Cars decided to halt investments in Polestar (NASDAQ: ) after the money-losing luxury EV offshoot brand missed a 2023 delivery target.

Some industry observers argue that the long-term picture of a transition to EVs remains in place despite any short-term road bumps.

""A slowdown in the growth rate from 45% to something more sustainable is not the disaster the press has been pushing. And interest rates affect all car sales, not just EVs,"" said Vitaly Golomb, a Rivian investor and investment banker who focuses on mobility.

""The effect is more pronounced on more expensive vehicles of course and EVs still average higher price,"" he added. ""Perhaps (automakers) need to emphasize the stark difference in total cost of ownership."""
Lucid Group,Analyst says Lucid stock price may fall 20% as it is 'gasping for air',2024-02-22,07:35,AM,"Published Feb 22, 2024 07:35AM ET

© Reuters. Analyst says Lucid (LCID) stock price may fall 20% as it is 'gasping for air'

LCID -1.95% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Lucid’s (LCID) shares tumbled more than 8% in premarket trading Thursday after the company posted worse-than-expected FQ4 earnings and issued a disappointing delivery guidance for fiscal 2024.

The company reported a loss per share of $0.29, slightly better than the analyst predictions of a $0.30 loss. However, its quarterly revenue of $157.2 million did not meet the expected $178.33 million consensus estimate.

Looking ahead to 2024, Lucid (NASDAQ: ) has set its annual production target of 9,000 vehicles, significantly below the average projection of 23,000 vehicles.

Evercore sees 20% downside risk in LCID stock

Commenting on Lucid’s report and outlook, Evercore ISI analysts said the company’s “stock story remains extremely difficult as it is hard to point to any solid catalyst” for it to overcome a myriad of challenges it is currently facing.

Waning consumer demand and “the fog of EV price/demand wars” amidst high interest rates, coupled with disappointing delivery guidance, are likely to “continue to leave the stock gasping for “Air”,” wrote Evercore ISI analysts.

The broker set a price target on the stock of $3, implying a downside risk of nearly 20% from the latest closing price.

Cantor Fitzgerald downgrades LCID to UW

In response to LCID’s poor guidance for this year, Cantor Fitzgerald analysts cut their rating on the stock from Neutral to Underweight on Thursday, citing “high negative gross margins, lower-than-expected annual production guidance, and lower customer demand.”

The investment firm also reduced its price target on the stock from $6 to $4.

For the fourth quarter of 2023 and the full fiscal year, the company reported gross margins of roughly -161% and -225%, respectively, aligning with the broker’s predictions of -159% and -220%.

But despite these figures, Cantor Fitzgerald’s conservative outlook does not anticipate LCID achieving positive gross margins until Q4 2024 “at the earliest,” analysts said.

On a brighter note, the investment firm maintains an optimistic perspective regarding the unveiling of the Gravity, and believes it will enable Lucid to target the SUV market competitively in terms of pricing.

The recently unveiled Gravity is expected to receive a positive reception from customers, analysts noted, although the start of production (SOP) is not forecasted until the fourth quarter of 2024, with deliveries commencing in 2025.

“However, while we believe LCID's vehicles are amongst the best in the industry, we are becoming more conservative in the short term given a disappointing FY24 production guidance, persistently high negative gross margins, lower-than-anticipated demand, and slower deliveries to Saudi Arabia than initially expected,” Cantor Fitzgerald analysts wrote."

By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: ) tumbled on Thursday after their earnings reports pointed to the impact of slowing electric-vehicle demand on their costly ramp-up plans.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) tanked 25% to a record low after it forecast flat growth in annual production, also hurt by a shutdown of its assembly line for upgrades. Lucid sank 9% as its production forecast also came below estimates.

The companies said an uncertain economic outlook and high interest rates were hitting demand for EVs, echoing remarks from market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and legacy automakers like Ford (NYSE: ).

""Despite having built a highly rated and desirable EV, Rivian appears to have hit a near-term air-pocket and caught the recent EV bug,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas, who cut his price target on the stock by $10 to $20.

EV startups have been burning billions of dollars in cash in their efforts to develop, source and ramp up manufacturing of vehicles, hoping to be the next Tesla.

Rivian was set to lose more than $3.5 billion in market capitalization, if the losses hold, while Lucid's valuation was set to fall by nearly $1 billion.

Their stocks have had a weak start to the year, with Rivian down 34% and Lucid down 12%, after a tumultuous 2023 when Tesla's price war roiled the industry.

Rivian said on Wednesday it expected to post its first gross profit in the fourth quarter, after it reported a loss of about $43,000 per vehicle in the October-December period.

In comparison, Ford's Model E electric vehicle division lost an average of more than $47,000 per vehicle in the same period.

CHEAPER MODELS

Rivian is betting on the R2 sport utility vehicle set to be unveiled next month to compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover and attract customers with a smaller and cheaper EV.

But the R2 SUV, which is expected to be priced around $50,000, is set to be launched only in 2026.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said much of the upgrades to the R1 assembly line in the second quarter were made to enable the R2 vehicles.

Lucid, meanwhile, plans to start production of the Gravity SUV, with more than 400 miles of range and expected to be priced at $80,000 later this year, with larger volumes expected in 2025 onwards.

Lucid also discussed a third model in the midsize category, slated for production in late 2026, but did not provide further details on the model.

""We view near-term deliveries as an unknown, with that uncertainty spreading to Lucid's Gravity SUV launch, with Lucid's midsize program set for a 2026 debut,"" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said."

LCID -1.95% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

(Reuters) -Lucid Group forecast annual vehicle production far below analysts' estimates on Wednesday, on signs that demand for its luxury electric vehicles will slow down as high interest rates pinch consumer budgets.

Shares of the company fell around 5% in extended trading.

The company expects to make 9,000 units for the full-year 2024 compared with estimates of 22,594 according to five analysts polled by Visible Alpha. The company made 8,428 vehicles in 2023.

The Saudi Arabia-backed company took to slashing prices once more for its Air sedans last week to counter sagging demand at a time when the EV industry is seeing a slowdown.

The company also missed estimates for fourth-quarter revenue hit by a slowdown in deliveries as consumers grapple with high costs.

Lucid (NASDAQ: ) reported revenue of $157.2 million, missing average analysts' estimate of $179.9 million, according to LSEG data."

LAYTON - In a groundbreaking initiative to reduce the environmental impact of mining, Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: ) Holdings has teamed up with Nodal Power to utilize landfill gas as an innovative energy source. The project, located at the Davis landfill in Layton, owned by the Wasatch Integrated Waste Management (NYSE: ) District, harnesses methane from organic waste decomposition to power Bitcoin miners.

The pilot site near Hill Air Force Base is a testament to the companies' commitment to sustainability and cost-efficiency. By fully burning landfill gas for electricity generation, the site manages to destroy more methane per month than traditional flaring methods. This not only provides Marathon with its cheapest energy source but also significantly reduces annual CO2 emissions associated with Bitcoin mining.

This partnership between Marathon Digital Holdings and Nodal Power dates back to a previous off-grid project in Price, where they initially used to power a Bitcoin mine. However, facing stiff competition from larger firms, Nodal Power shifted its focus towards addressing methane mitigation from landfills across the United States. Methane is a significant contributor to global warming, accounting for 14.3% of all methane emissions in the country.

Despite Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations on landfill gas collection and flaring, a study conducted in 2022 suggested that the conversion rate through flaring was only 91%, contradicting the EPA's claim of 99%. The current project at Davis landfill not only challenges these figures but also enhances methane destruction efficiency.

The success of this sustainable endeavor has encouraged both Marathon Digital Holdings and Nodal Power to consider expanding their efforts. They aim to replicate this model across hundreds of landfills in the US and globally, particularly those lacking proper infrastructure.

Utah has been actively pursuing methane mitigation efforts. An oil field near Moab ceased flaring natural gas during oil production and began using it for Bitcoin mining. Additionally, a facility in North Salt Lake is converting food waste into natural gas and fertilizer. These initiatives are crucial given that Utah squandered approximately $48 million worth of natural gas in 2019, exacerbating air quality and climate issues.

As these two companies share revenues from their innovative project with location-agnostic Bitcoin miners, they demonstrate a viable path forward for integrating renewable energy solutions into cryptocurrency mining operations.

By Valentine Hilaire

(Reuters) - Colombian-founded Simetrik, a startup offering business-to-business services to streamline complex financial tasks, raised $55 million in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs, which two executives said will be mainly used to boost activity beyond the region.

Simetrik's financial and accounting services are aimed at companies that make more than $150 million in sales every year and currently handles close to $150 billion in transactions annually, the startup's Chief Executive Alejandro Casas and Chief Operating Officer Santiago Gomez told Reuters in a video interview.

The company operates in over 35 countries, but 80% of its workforce is located in Latin America.

Simetrik has smaller-scale operations in Asia and Africa due to the global reach of such clients as U.S.-listed dLocal, and it is now seeking to expand further.

""One of the reasons Goldman Sachs invested in us is due to our global reach. We already have clients with operations in Asia, Africa and Europe, and we are implementing an aggressive expansion as we have already proven our model works everywhere,"" Simetrik's Casas said.

Falabella Ventures, Endeavor Catalyst and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) fund are among the other investors in Simetrik's Series B round. The company declined to say what total value was implied by the latest fundraising round.

Mexican bottler and retailer Femsa, Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco and Argentina's MercadoLibre are among the startup's clients."
MercadoLibre,Why MercadoLibre (MELI) Shares Are Trading Lower Today,2024-02-23,12:00,PM,"Published Feb 23, 2024 12:00PM ET Updated Feb 23, 2024 12:32PM ET

Why MercadoLibre (MELI) Shares Are Trading Lower Today

MELI -10.38% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

What Happened: Shares of latin American e-commerce and fintech company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) fell 13.4% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results that missed analysts' operating margin estimates. Looking under the hood, however, we can see that its lower profitability was caused by 1) non-recurring, non-cash expenses of $351 million that are mostly related to outstanding tax liabilities from a 2014 court case it had with the Brazilian federal tax authority, 2) lower Logistics segment margins as it offered more free shipping to customers in Brazil and Mexico through its new MELI+ loyalty program (similar to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime, the company re-launched MELI+ in 2023), and 3) strong growth in its 1P commerce business (54% year-on-year growth), which has lower margins than its 3P marketplace business because in 1P, the company buys and holds inventory on its balance sheet.

MercadoLibre reported robust user growth this quarter, enabling it to beat analysts' revenue, total payment volume (TPV), and gross merchandise volume (GMV) estimates (TPV of $56.5 billion vs estimates of $49 billion, GMV of $13.5 billion vs estimates of $12.4 billion). Specifically for TPV, the company's new credit card offering for its Brazil and Mexico customers stood out, helping accelerate off-platform TPV growth to 64% year on year in Q4 vs 55% growth for the full year 2023 (off-platform refers to payments transacted outside its e-commerce marketplace). Profitability across its entire credit book rose to nearly a 40% margin, which is also quite impressive. We believe MELI achieved this profitability because it can underwrite its customers better than traditional banks through its access to granular transaction-level data from its commerce business.

Double-clicking into the commerce business, two segments stood out during the quarter: Logistics and Advertising. On the Logistics side, MELI delivered more items per vehicle in 2023 as customers increasingly utilized MELI+. The increased deliveries per vehicle boosted the company's efficiency, and it ended 2023 having shipped over 50% of all e-commerce orders in Brazil and over 80% of all e-commerce orders in Mexico. Furthermore, it fulfilled 52% of orders in one day or less and 75% within 48 hours. On the nascent but rapidly growing advertising side of the business, MercadoLibre added 50,000 new advertisers to its platform in 2023 and grew its advertising revenue by 70% year on year.

The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy MercadoLibre? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

What is the market telling us: MercadoLibre's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 7 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for MercadoLibre and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 7 months ago, when the stock gained 6.4% on the news that the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded analysts' estimates for revenue, gross merchandise volume, operating profits, and earnings per share. User growth stayed strong, and ARPU was stable. The company also continued to generate positive cash flows. Overall, it was an impressive quarter for the company.

MercadoLibre is up 7.1% since the beginning of the year, but at $1,638 per share it is still trading 9.9% below its 52-week high of $1,818 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of MercadoLibre's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,365."

Full transcript - MercadoLibre (MELI) Q4 2023:

Operator: Hello, everyone and welcome to the MercadoLibre's Earnings Conference Call for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Thank you for joining us. I’m Richard Cathcart, MercadoLibre’s Investor Relations Officer. Today we will share our quarterly highlights on video, after which we will begin our live Q&A session with our CEO, Marcos Galperin, Chief Financial Officer Martin de los Santos, Fintech President, Osvaldo Gimenez and Commerce EVP Ariel Szarfsztejn. Before we go onto discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2023, I’ll remind you that management may make or refer to and this presentation may contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. So please refer to the disclaimer on screen which will also be available in our earnings materials on our investor relations website. With that, let’s begin with a summary of our results. Hello everyone. I’m delighted to share that MercadoLibre delivered solid results in Q4 marking a strong conclusion and outstanding year. Overall, 2023 highlighted their strength of our financial model and it’s future potential as well as a powerful impact of compounding of several years of investment in technology. For our commerce business it was a year of accelerated growth and market share gains in most countries. We achieved this but continued to make improvements and the value proposition to buyers and sellers in our marketplace. I would like to highlight three important initiatives that contributed to our success in commerce. We continued to invest in having the widest product assortment in order to offer the best buying experience to consumers. A key contributor to this was the acceleration of our first-party business, particularly in Brazil, where it grew by 81% in 2023. We continued expanding our logistic network with record fulfillment penetration of almost 50%, which provided an improved user experience to our buyers. This resulted in faster shipping and fewer late deliveries, particularly around the Christmas season. Our ads business continues to deliver impressive results, growing revenues at an accelerated pace. In 2023, we on boarded almost 50,000 new advertisers who appreciate the value of promoting their products on our parent regional platform. On the Fintech front, Mercado Pago maintained strong momentum as users and merchants continued to adopt our services. In acquiring business, we delivered solid TPV growth and gained market share in most countries where we operate, both in online as well as in-store payments. We made improvements in approval rates and deployed new features that enabled us to move up market, enhancing the value proposition to SMBs. In Fintech services, we have expanded our product offering and made improvements to user experience. The increased engagement with our products resulted in Mercado Pago achieving the milestone of surpassing for the first time 50 million active users in a single quarter. The credit business continues to be an important piece of our Fintech strategy, and it delivered another quarter of strong results with accelerated growth and solid spreads as we continue to cautiously manage risks. During Q4, Meli delivered strong financial results. Revenues grew by 42%, accelerating both in Fintech as well as commerce due to the strong execution during the peak season and investments we made throughout the year. For the quarter, we delivered a 13.4% EBIT margin, excluding one-off expenses from previous years as explained in the letter to share folders. This represents margin improvement from Q4 of 2022 while we continue to invest in building a logistic infrastructure, supporting our MELI+ loyalty program as well as expanding our credit card offering. Following our strong financial performance in 2023 it’s a good time to reflect on the journey over the past six years. During that time frame, we multiplied our revenues by 10x while achieving significant improvements in profitability, culminating in nearly $2 billion of operating income in 2023. In recent years, we have increased our investment in technology, which enabled us to launch multiple products and services and make significant improvements in user experience. We have grown our development team by more than 10,000 in the last three years alone and currently have 16,000 engineers who are constantly working to create the best experience for our users. We remain committed to our technology-led strategy in order to continue delivering sustainable results for Meli. We enter 2024 with optimism about our growth opportunities and confidence in our capacity to continue to execute on our strategy. Now, back to Richard to share some product initiatives from 2023.

Richard Cathcart: As a technology company with more than 15,000 developers, launching products and features is at the heart of our business as we continue to innovate. Innovation is about new products and businesses, but it's also about being attentive to and passionate about detail and solving multiple small customer pain points that compound into a great user experience. 2023 was no different. We've launched several new products and services such as the MELI Mas loyalty program, Meli delivery day, credit cards for consumers in Mexico and businesses in Brazil, amongst many other things. We've also vastly improved our core products with several new experiences that build onto our value proposition as we continue to strive to offer our users the best experience. Today, we want to share some of this year's highlights. In commerce, we continue to look at the specific needs of each vertical to improve the user experience as we believe this will drive offline consumption online. In 2023, we considerably improved the navigation in fashion, apparel and sports with standardized filters across brands and sellers. This enables consumers to find what they need more quickly. On the product pages, users can also see the more like this section to find similar items to a product that the user has clicked on rather than simply going back to the search results. This feature is powered by artificial intelligence. AI-based features are already an integral part of the Meli experience with many innovations launched in 2023, including a summary of customer reviews on the product pages that concentrates the main feedback from buyers of that product. On beauty product pages, a summary of products, functions and characteristics is automatically created that facilitate buyer’s choices. Push notifications about items left unpurchased in shopping carts are now highly personalized and remind users why they may have chosen to buy a particular product. We have also added an AI feature that helps sellers to respond to questions by preparing answers that sellers can send immediately or edits quickly. To deliver a better experience to our sellers, we launched a new version of the seller hub where they can see all of the promotional campaigns available for them to participate in. A new pricing tool also enables sellers to easily compare prices with competitors and or similar products and receive insights and recommendations on how to boost sales. In 2023, we also re-launched our ads tech stack. An automated buying platform was launched for display ads accompanied by live reports and unique insight analysis. We enhanced our bidding algorithm for product ads and introduced new placements on search and product pages that give more visibility to sponsored products. Our brand ad solution was also launched as a mid-funnel campaign option to enhance consideration for brands. Our platform also now includes a feature for agencies to be able to manage different brands through the platform. Brands, sellers and official stores can delegate certain products or even the whole assortment to a specific agency. The agencies are now available to manage all accounts delegated to them in one place. And to expand the possibilities given to advertisers, a new pool of custom audiences was launched and later expanded enabling advertisers to use filters to create an infinite combination of audiences for their campaigns. Finally, in advertising, MELI Play was launched as an ads-based streaming platform. Through a revenue share model with studios, we were able to offer free content to our users across the region enabling us to explore a new revenue stream for ads. In logistics, most of the technological improvements were behind the scenes and were crucial in helping us to maintain costs broadly stable as a percentage of GMV whilst expanding fulfillment penetration. We optimized routes from first to last mile, fulfillment-centered processes and demand prediction. On the UX front, buyers are now notified that their package is being delivered and can follow it through their app. And for sellers that adopt fulfillment, an enhanced tool to manage inventory brings more technology to the process flagging products that need to be replenished, how many units should be sent to us, amongst other things. At Mercado Pago, we continue to innovate as we consolidate our position as one of the region's leading Fintechs. In the acquiring business, the launch of the Mercado Pago tap brings a free POS option to merchants by turning their cell phones into a tool to receive payments via NFC technology. We also improved the pairing process of mobile POS devices with merchants' cell phones and worked behind the scenes to reduce processing times, which had a positive impact on NPS and helped to improve the experience of merchants and buyers. With more personalization in the Mercado Pago app, our seller homepage now prioritizes the features that merchants most need on a day-to-day basis. In Fintech services, we continue to search for ways to facilitate financial inclusion. We expanded our credit card offer to Mexico and launched our collateralized credit card solution in Brazil where the user receives a credit limit equivalent to the value of funds deposited into their account. These products enable consumers to start building a credit score and take advantage of the possibilities that a credit card brings for many for the first time ever. Innovations in credit enabled us to attract new users. For merchants, we now offer a business credit card using Open Finance to contribute to scoring. For consumers in our lower-risk cohorts, a new product enables them to opt for larger, longer-duration loans in our app, personalizing the loan to their needs and expanding the use cases of our credit product. As our product stack expands, we have focused on facilitating and simplifying navigation around all of the different products available on Mercado Pago. Our digital account homepage combines the most used features, such as transfers, credit limits, investment positions and insurance, adapting to the user's profile. We have seen increased traffic to all of our key digital account products as a result. Digital account users in Brazil can now see a summary of their monthly activity on a personalized report, an enhancement that brings more information to the user about their finances.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Andrew Ruben of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Andrew Ruben: Thanks very much for the detail and for the question. I'd like to dig in a bit on the logistics network. We see that the net shipping fees and some of the shipping costs looks like it was a bit more of a drag than in recent quarters. So I was wondering if you could help with what changed sequentially, whether it was more seasonality or if there's been, let's say, sequential changes in investment areas such as shipping campaigns or DC builds in the quarter. And then perhaps zooming out a bit on the logistics network, how you think about the state of the network, where you are for shipping fees, and how you think about the intensity of investment in those areas for the year ahead versus 2023. Any comment there would be very helpful. Thank you.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Okay. Through compared to last year, lower delay rates, more fulfillment penetration, particularly in Brazil, and more free shipping coming from Melimise together with a network that has expanded over the year and particularly in Q3. So going to your specific question about margin compression or sequential margin compression, we also experienced some cost pressures during Q4 that you will see reverted in early Q1. And basically those headwinds in Q4 come mainly for the following reasons. Number one, this is the first quarter in which Melimise has been fully operating. And that means that we have increased the level of free shipping offered in Brazil and Mexico. I think we've discussed before Melimise is a strategic and long-term investment that we think will continue increasing loyalty and driving incremental orders and GMB. So it's a conscious investment on our part. Second, I think the growth of 1P in our business, who’s GMB was 50% higher quarter-over-quarter in dollars also acts as a headwind basically because there are no sellers paying for shipping revenues given that we are the sellers in the case of 1P. I think that's going to point number three. In previous quarters, we flagged that some of the shipping gains in terms of take rates were due to the negotiated postponement of cost increases from our suppliers after already having passed through higher prices to seller at the start of the year. And those costs are now hitting our P&L as we were expecting. And on the fourth, I think Argentina also added some pressure as we decided not to fully pass inflation through to our prices on the spot in an environment with accelerated inflation and a lot of uncertainty in the market. Of course, then you have peak season, which is the biggest component of the sequential compression of shipping costs. There is ramp up in capacity to be able to attend demand coming from our buyers. There is also an increase in unit costs coming from labor hours and bands and truck drivers, etcetera. And that is the biggest component of the sequential compression, which you will see probably reverted in early Q1 in 2024. Finally, and just to wrap up on this first part of the question, it's also important to note that we were expecting most of these increases in cost, and that is one of the reasons why we decided to increase our flat fees. So the charge that we make to the sellers when they sell items below the free shipping threshold. If you recall, we increased that fee in Brazil in approximately July or August, and we did the same in late Q3 in Mexico. And this is one of the levers we have used to manage our shipping P&L as well. And it's a good example of how we manage the profit and loss of the company in a consolidated manner and not on a line-by-line basis. So to your second part of the question, I think, as we've been saying many times, in the long run there will be opportunities for us to continue monetizing our logistics network. We are not desperate for that. We think long-term not only in monetization, but also in remaining competitive in terms of prices to our buyers and to our sellers, and we are conscious on how to execute around that opportunity.

Andrew Ruben: Very helpful, color. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Irma Sgarz of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Irma Sgarz: Hi. I hope you can hear me well. Connectivity has been a bit patchy. I have two very quick questions. Firstly, on Mexico, sequentially the margin was a little bit lower into the fourth quarter, which is obviously to be expected given the seasonality. But 1P, I think, plays less of a role here. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the drivers here. I imagine some of the logistics capacity ramp-up has to do with that. But is there anything else that we should be mindful of? And then on the commerce take rate, this builds a little bit on the earlier question, but we also noticed that there was a sequential decline quarter-over-quarter. And it is just basically sort of a reflection of and I'm excluding 1P here but is that just mostly really a reflection of category mix and logistics? And is there anything else at play that we should – in the revenues and shipping revenue dynamics that you just described – that we should be mindful of, especially as we look into 2024 and think about this line, whether there should be further compression coming into the commerce take rate? And maybe, sorry, if you can also add to that the influence that lower funding cost of rates that should be positive for the take rate. But I don't think we saw much of an effect, if I'm not mistaken. So if you could just also speak to that. Thank you.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Hey, Irma. Ariel here again. So on Mexico's sequential compression, I think you were spot on with some of your hypotheses. And it relates to what I was explaining before. So everything that I just described about operating in peak season with building capacity before the event and increasing unit costs is actually more complex in Mexico for two reasons. On the one hand, in Mexico, during Q4, we opened three fulfillment centers and one cross-docking station, big cross-docking station. As we've been pointing out over the last few quarters, we have a capacity constraint there that we need to fix. And of course, whenever you open new warehouses such as these ones, the ramp-up process is a bit costly. And that's part of what has happened over the quarter. Secondly, our existing warehouses were operating at maximum capacity. And that also puts an extra pressure in terms of productivity for our fulfillment operations. So in the end, there's nothing that we were surprised about. We are managing the cost and the performance of the network. But we think we are in good shape for the future. So no comments on the second part of the question on some things that you should expect or that we should call out there.

Martin de los Santos: Irma, it's Martin here. Regarding the funding cost being lower, it should benefit the credit business, of course, because it lowers the cost of funding for that operation. So that should improve NIMAL. And it also should help us on both the commerce side as well as the Fintech side, because it lowers the cost of discounting coupons. So that should result in improvements in margins.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: So probably, let me be clear on that, Martin. Probably, you will see more of an impact with regards to the marketplace, where the fee we charge for including installments is fixed on the Fintech side of business, on the acquiring side of business. Many times when the funding cost is lower, we end up passing some of those savings to consumers. And that is not as straightforward in the marketplace. Thank you, Irma.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ford (NYSE: ) of Bank of America. Your line is open.

Robert Ford: Good evening, everybody, and congratulations on the quarter. I was curious, how should we think about service transfer pricing and the recurring tax impact on profitability? And when it comes to advertising, how should we think about ad penetration rates in 2024 and the receptiveness of the product stack with larger display advertisers now that they've had time to really understand the product and maybe build their budgets coming into this year?

Martin de los Santos: Hi, Bob. I think you're referring to the withholding, the incremental withholding tax that we started booking this quarter, as we explained on the short-hold letter. I think if you, obviously, it's a big charge, and this is the reason why we excluded from the results, to explain results, because it generated a big distortion in Q4 results. That's to put in perspective a full charge of roughly $350 million. Only 6% of that corresponds to this particular quarter. The way to look at that is by roughly, I would say, $20 million incremental cost per quarter will resolve for this incremental tax that we're going to be starting to provision from now on. Just to complement that, keep in mind that the $350 million one-off charge were fully funded because throughout the last 10 years, we're funding a judiciary account with those amounts. So if in the event that we lose this case, we will continue disputing it, the event that we lose it, it will not have a material cash impact on our results. So in summary, I think it's about $20 million per quarter, the impact going forward.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Bob, this is Ariel. So going back to your question on advertising, I think, start by saying that we are extremely pleased with the ad result from the quarter. Our revenues grew 72% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. It's the seventh consecutive quarter going above 70%, and that's driven mainly by Brazil and Mexico. I think as we mentioned in our shareholder letter, we added 53,000 new advertisers this year, and this is a great achievement and shows how strong the level of interest in our product is today, and we expect to build on that in the coming quarter. On sequential penetration, I think while ads continue to grow at a very fast pace, GMV accelerated at an even faster pace this quarter, and it is the case that ad revenue does not necessarily follow one-to-one the growth pattern of our GMV. Particularly during Q4, our GMV accelerated from 59% growth in Q3 to 79% in Q4, and it's worth maybe highlighting the case of Argentina, which represents 20% of our GMV, but only around 10% of our ad revenue. That's the main offender for sequential penetration. In such a high inflation context, the lack of stocks in the seller hands disincentivized some of the ad investments, and simultaneously, advertisers were not necessarily updating their investment amounts together with their item prices, and for that, we did already deploy some features that automatically update ad budgets whenever there is an inflationary context in item prices. So, as I was saying before, we remain extremely confident in our product stack, and we see ample opportunities for growth in the coming years. Regarding display, it's been not so long for our current product format to be live, and we are going through the learning curve in terms of go-to-market strategies, as well as the brands are still learning about branding possibilities in MercadoLibre. So, we believe in the product that we have, in the value proposition we are offering with display ads as an awareness tool for one of the largest audiences in Latin America, but we need to be patient, and we think that we can continue building on the product we have to gain even more traction and make a display an even bigger business for MercadoLibre and for our sellers.

Robert Ford: A very helpful idea. Thank you so much.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Kaio Prato of UBS. Your line is open.

Kaio Prato: Hey. Good evening. Thanks for the opportunity. So, I have one question on the credit portfolio, please. I saw your origination was much higher this quarter, and you mentioned that your own credit card is one of the most used in your platform, I think among the five most used. So, I just would like to have a sense about how much of this origination is coming from the credit card, and how are you seeing the contributions specifically of the credit card in your GMV today? In other words, what's the level of GMV penetration today versus one year ago? And finally, what makes you comfortable with the credit card origination today? Because we are already seeing some spike in short-term NPLs, which is attributed to this product. Thank you.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Hi, Kaio. Let me start by the end, and then I'll go back to the first questions. With regards to what makes us more comfortable, we first launched credit cards in Brazil three years ago, and we have been iterating the models we use to score grades. We have done many iterations, several every year. And each iteration we do, we get better results. We saw the credit situation overall in Brazil worsened a year and a half ago, two years ago. So we were more cautious. And now, throughout last year, we started feeling more and more comfortable, and we have been increasing the amount of origination in Brazil. And also, we launched a credit card in Mexico, and we've been, I would say, aggressive in rolling it up. When we look at, as we say in the shareholder letters, when we look at total payment volume for our credit card, year-over-year, it has grown well above 100%. So we have been aggressive with regards to that. In terms of portfolio, there has been high origination. We have not disclosed the origination amount, but we have disclosed the total portfolio. And you can see how the chunk coming from the credit card is growing. It has reached $1.2 billion, which is nearly 100% growth versus a year ago. And on top of that, I would say that the credit card is growing in exactly the way we expected it to grow. We are expanding in the lower segments and also starting to have a little more traction in the higher segments. And the penetration we see in the marketplace is growing in Brazil and in Mexico. And most importantly, when we look at the total penetration of credits in the marketplace, which adds our consumer loans and our credit card is growing significantly. So it's not that we are cannibalizing consumer loans with a credit card, which has probably lower profitability per transaction, but rather that we are adding to that number.

Kaio Prato: Okay, thank you. Can you share the level of penetration nowadays in your platform?

Ariel Szarfsztejn: I would say this is, we have not disclosed the precise level. We can disclose that this is the largest means of payment we have today in Mexico.

Kaio Prato: Okay, thank you very much.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Credit, I mean, no total payments. All of the credit products available are on credit and credit card is the largest one.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Maria Infanto. Your line is open. Pardon me, Maria Clara Infanto. Your line is open.

Maria Clara Infantozzi: Hello, everyone. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So I would like to explore the profitability of the 1P operations in the release you mentioned that you achieved better profitability trends, despite the seasonality of the business in the fourth quarter. So can you please give us more granularity on how the contribution margin of the business has been evolving lately? We feel that the accelerated growth of the category has been allowing you to have better negotiations in terms of suppliers. And how do you feel about the growth potential of the channel going forward? How far are we from reaching an optimum stability level in the division? Thank you.

Martin de los Santos: Hi, Maria. Thank you for your question. Yes, we have made significant progress in the 1P business throughout the year, and we feel that we are a much more sustainable footing today than we were a year ago. As you say, we made improvements on margins. We look at our product purchase margin has improved a few percentage points in 2023, and we expect to continue improving that. That gave us confidence to grow our business, and we did grow it in Q4 by 60% year-on-year in dollars and 85% in local currency, taking advantage of the obviously the peak season that we had in Mexico as well as Black Friday. So we are making significant progress. As I mentioned, one way of looking at the 1P business is obviously we don't share the actual profitability of the business, but I can give you some guidance in terms of how we're doing. If you were to look at the 1P business now, it is profitable before considering fixed costs and including all variable costs, that is shipping as well as financing. So one way to look at it is the more volume we have, the better we dilute the fixed cost of that business. So we are at a point where we feel that we can scale the business and should start to contribute to lower the deficits that we have in terms of area. Finally, we think we have plenty of room to continue to attach more advertising into that business, and that creates a big opportunity to continue improving profitability of 1P.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Ariel here, just to complement Martin. So we continue to think that 1P is strategic in order for us to sustain our competitive position, to gain market share, and more importantly, to satisfy customer demands through better selection and price competitiveness. So we continue to be strategic in deciding which categories and products we serve with 1P while simultaneously optimizing our consolidated P&L. So while we don't have a specific target regarding 1P penetration for the future, we are encouraged by the progress we've made in terms of profitability, in terms of supplier relationships and operating processes. And the more confident we feel about that, the more confident, the more probability that we could scale in the future, and the bigger we get, the more benefits of scale we will capture, as Martin was saying just before. Having said that, there is seasonality in terms of category demand and the role that 1P plays in the different categories, particularly consumer electronics was a high demand category during big season, and it's one category where 1P plays an even more strategic role for us. So to wrap up, we have many initiatives in place to continue improving our retail business, both in terms of economics as well as in terms of selection, price management, and supplier relationships, and we'll continue to work on that.

Maria Clara Infantozzi: Perfect. Very clear. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young of Barclays. Your line is open.

Trevor Young: Great. Thanks. First one, just to build on the earlier question on advertising, can you remind us where we are in terms of penetration on a geographic basis? I think to your earlier comments, advertising may be remaining softer in Argentina and perhaps stronger in Mexico and Brazil. Just any numbers to help kind of frame the progression there, particularly as the GMB growth in Argentina is probably optically making that ad penetration look weaker. And then secondly, in Argentina, items growth accelerating for the second straight quarter up 22%, I think. How much of that is related to kind of the worsening inflation dynamic in that market and more of that pull forward of consumption versus maybe some improvement in consumer demand? And just appreciate that you don't give any guidance, but at a high level, do you think that degree of unit growth is durable? Thank you.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Hey, Trevor. Ariel here. I think we don't disclose specific numbers in terms of penetration by country, but we have shared that while the overall ad revenue penetration as percentage of GMB was 1.6% in Q4, if you were to exclude Argentina from that equation, you would get something like 1.9. So Argentina is definitely a big detractor in terms of measuring ad revenue as percentage of GMB.

Martin de los Santos: Yes, and the successful item sold that you mentioned in Argentina is just like you said, we saw the first half of the year where items were flat year-on-year, mainly because of the recession that we faced in the first half of 2023. Then the second half was a government put more money in people's pockets. We saw a pickup in volume, both in terms of GMB and item sold, which increased 12% in Q3 and accelerated to 21% in Q4. And that part of that is inflation, is like advanced purchases ahead of expected devaluation towards the end of the year, which eventually happened in December with the new government and towards the second half of December. We saw a slowdown of those volumes. But that's correct, your assumption about our consumption.

Trevor Young: Great. Thank you both.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of João Soares of Citi. Your line is open.

João Soares: Hi, thank you. Yes, just one more one question on my end. I just wanted to get, I'm just trying to understand the different moving parts for the operating profit margin thinking about 2024. I think you mentioned that we should see some reversion in terms of the logistics cost pressure rating in the first quarter. And of course, we have, structural growth, the 1P business, of course, affected by naturally, there's going to be seasonality, but on a more on a year, we should see an increase in penetration of the 1P. So just want to try to understand, different moving parts, also taking into consideration that you're growing, again, your credit portfolio within credit cards, which should come with increasing provisions. So I know it's, I don't want to see a forward looking statement, but just trying to understand what should we have in mind for different moving parts for your operating profit margin. Thank you.

Martin de los Santos: Thank you, João for your question. First of all, I will discuss a margin. Let me verify that all the numbers that we'll be discussing, contemplate the adjustment for the $351 million of one-offs, given the size of it, we felt that it was easier to explain and taking those, that one-off out and obviously, including the appropriate cost corresponding to this particular quarter. I would say that if you look at margins on a year-on-year basis, excluding the one-off that I mentioned before, we improved margins by 270 basis points because of expanding the business and basically growing the business and diluting our fixed costs, while at the same time, we continue to invest behind the many growth opportunities. One of them is credit cards, as you mentioned, but also fulfillment and several other things that we're doing at the company. This is something that we plan to continue. We think that we run a business that should scale very nicely in the long term and we'll continue to focus on managing costs very efficiently and as we continue to grow the business, we should be able to continue scaling in the long term. Q4 in particular is a quarter with seasonality in terms of lower margins because of investments that we make in commerce, particularly behind the special events of Black Friday and Blue Wednesday. Furthermore, during Q4, we intensified certain investments, as Ari mentioned before, such as fulfillment, 1P, and free shipping. If you were to look at the sequential compressions of margins, we have roughly four and a half points of compressions in margins. That compression comes mainly from 1P and shipping, which affects our cost of goods sold. In terms of our 1P business, two-thirds of the compression comes from the 1P business, as Ari mentioned. The revenues of 1P grew from 9% to 12% of total revenues. You can see that in our disclosures. And as you know, 1P has a different margin structure than 3P because almost 100% of the GMB is booked as revenues compared to just the take rate of the 3P business. So although there was pressure on the margin, the incremental negative impact on EBIT due to 1P was only $20 million during the Q [ph]. On the other hand, we generated more than $220 million incremental GMB from 1P, which resulted in market share gains of almost 10% of points on consumer electronics category, as Ari was mentioning before. The other part of the compression comes from shipping. As Ari mentioned, there is a seasonality factor in shipping during Q4, which comes with higher costs associated with peak seasons. It happened this quarter, and we expect this trend to revert back to normal the following quarters. And then finally, investments that we're making, and we have been flagging over the last few quarters to the market, investments on a value proposition, which includes the launching of more fulfillment centers. We launched three. We implemented three new fulfillment centers this quarter. The increased adoption of Melimise, which resulted in higher levels of free shipping. We put all those together. That explains the compression that you see quarter-on-quarter.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Let me add to that your question regarding credit portfolio and provisions. Throughout this year, we have been able to expand our credit portfolio and furthermore, gain share in credit cards. Despite that, we have been able to increase our net interest margin after losses and also decrease NPLs, which have pierced 30% for the first time in quite some time. Again, we don't guide, but we are confident with how the credit business is evolving.

João Soares: Perfect. Thank you so much.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Deepak Mathivanan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I apologize if this was asked already, but one big picture question and then one tactical one. If you think about logistics, what are the big initiatives for 2024, maybe with respect to expanding the fulfillment centers or the middle mile and last mile operations? How should we think about the CapEx levels as we progress through the year? Then second one on competition, e-commerce players from China have cost pretty significant shifts and moved into the U.S. It is anticipated in several Latin markets. Can you share any color on your thoughts and how you're positioning the business for any sort of potential competitive intensity growing? Thanks so much.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Hey, Deepak. How are you, it’s Ariel. In terms of logistics, I think we don't guide and we don't disclose future numbers in terms of performance, etcetera. But just to reiterate what I said and Martin tried to explain. So most of the sequential compression on logistics was coming from peak season cost, which has been reverting during early Q1. So that's important. Having said that, we have many, many projects on hand to execute during 2024, none of which we think should drastically change the way we manage our P&L. We will invest in faster delivery. We will continue investing in slower delivery simultaneously. We will continue testing more automation and robotics as we have been doing so over the last few years. We will continue working with our technology team. We have thousands of developers fully dedicated to improving the processes and the experience of our customers with logistics and the way we operate inside our warehouses and processing stations. So all-in-all, we will focus in becoming more efficient, in serving our customers better, in improving our delivery promises and execution, and to support the business of the marketplace with more categories and better services. Regarding the Asian competition, I'd say we've seen Temu in particular more present in Mexico over the last few months. But still, as you can see from our results, we grew 32% year-over-year in items sold in Mexico. So we are extremely pleased with how we are executing in the countries. All categories in Mexico are showing good year-over-year GMB growth. While we see some of the Asian players focused on apparel and home and mostly focused on low ASP items, we see our growth in those segments extremely healthy. So in the end, we are confident that our competitive advantages, particularly logistics and payment, remain strong. We have a unique logistics network. We have a unique buy-now-pay-later and credit card offering in Brazil, Mexico, etcetera which we think will continue helping us drive our business and our market share gains in those markets. So to wrap up, in the past several years, we have been successful in competing against Asian players who were executing strategies similar to the ones that current players are executing. So we expect to continue doing so in the future, building on our strengths and successfully competing against whoever is operating in each of the markets where we are.

Martin de los Santos: Just on your question on CapEx, obviously we don't guide future expenditures, but this year, 2023, was roughly $500 million invested on CapEx, which was fully funded with our own cash flow generation.

Deepak Mathivanan: Okay, thank you so much.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Marcelo Santos of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Pardon me, Marcelo Santos, your line is open.

Marcelo Santos: Thank you. Sorry for having a bad line. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is about MELI Mas. Is MELI Mas net negative in terms of P&L? I understand it has recurring benefits and has a lot of loyalty benefits, but when you think about the P&L impact, is it negative now and should it remain negative in the future? That's the first question. The second question is, did you also see this seasonal, this peak cost last year, or was something that you had stronger this year because you were running at fewer capacities? Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Thank you for your question. The first part of the question was related to MELI Mas. Okay, sorry. We don't look at MELI Mas as an individual P&L. We look at this as a way to generate incrementality in our marketplace. You break it down between content. Content is basically cost neutral because we pass on the benefits that we get. Basically, the cost that we pay for the content, we pass it on to our consumers. And then the shipping, obviously, we provide more free shipping, but that generates incremental volume that then in turn should finance that operation. In the short term, we are investing behind this initiative because we're also investing in advertising, but it shouldn't be looked at as an individual P&L and more so as part of the critical part of our strategy for commerce.

Martin de los Santos: And then regarding the peak season, if we saw a particular peak, a special peak in terms of cost, probably this quarter, the incrementality of cost due to peak season was a little bit higher than we saw last year. But again, as Ari mentioned, this is something that we'll revert in the following quarters. And I was expected to have a peak in incremental cost during peak season.

Marcelo Santos: Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Soomit Datta of New Street Research. Your line is open.

Soomit Datta: Hi there. Yes, thanks very much for taking the question. Just one at this stage, please. On Argentina and the Fintech business, as we kind of contemplate entering a recessionary environment in Argentina, how should we think about the Fintech business? The e-commerce business is a bit more kind of logical to me in that sort of environment in terms of thinking about consumer demand, et cetera, units sold. But just on the Fintech side, it's not clear to me kind of what the drivers will be exactly under that scenario. If you could kind of help me with that, that would be great. Thanks.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: I would say, let me try to split the question between the different businesses we have. With regards to acquiring, I would say it's a business that also is very much independent of there being a recession. No, obviously, the volumes are impacted, but we are growing so much by gaining share, and the impact tends to be, could be smaller. Let us not get into what will happen in the future, but it's a business that people still continue to sell and process payments. So it will come by a little bit, is basically the growth rate, but no more than that. Where we've been more cautious is on the Fintech services side of the business on issuing credit. We don't have yet a credit card in Argentina, and we have been more cautious throughout the fourth quarter, even before the elections, knowing that there could be an evaluation and there could be increased NPLs. And that's why we were already more cautious towards the end of last year, and most of the volume growth you saw is coming from Mexico and Brazil and not from Argentina. And then we'll see what happens with the other Fintech service products. What we're seeing today is an inflation that in Q4 and even today has peaked and is higher than it was, and that is a further incentive, and we have seen that for people to bring money from their bank into the Mercado Pago account, which is currently remunerating 80% year-on-year, and it's a huge advantage versus zero at most banks. So we saw throughout the fourth quarter an increase in asset under management. You don't see that in total numbers because the evaluation at the end of the year, but in local currency, we grew assets in our account by 6x year-over-year. So I would say that I'm comfortable with the impact we saw towards the end of last year. We cannot predict what we don't forecast what will happen in the future.

Martin de los Santos: And if I may complement, the credit business in Argentina continues to have the lowest NPL compared to all other markets, and it continues to be extremely profitable.

Soomit Datta: Great, thank you.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes in line of Neha Agarwala of HSBC. Your line is open.

Neha Agarwala: Hi, thank you for taking my question. A quick one. I noticed that the ticket size for your credit card loans across the segment have been coming off. Is this a conscious decision, or is this a trend based on the demand that you're seeing from your client? And any color on the credit uptake in Mexico, what kind of products are working in Mexico? How is the response on the credit card? That would be very helpful. Thank you so much.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Let me start with the first part of the question, and then take on the second one. The first one, I would say, with regard to the credit card loans, they have been falling. It has been totally been a conscious decision. What we have been doing is reaching out to more consumers who did not have a credit card in the past with micro lines, what we say that is typically 100 or 200 [Indiscernible] lines. So it's really small lines. And also with what we call warranted cards, where we ask people to deposit 100 or 200 or 300 reais in their account and offer a card that is warranted by that amount. So definitely, that has been part of our strategy in order to be, for many of these people, the first time they get a credit card. And with regards to, you mentioned credit uptake in Mexico. I would say that basically, we have been growing a lot. First, the credit card, which is the latest product we launched, and has been a quite successful launch. And when you look at the combined volume we are loaning to consumers, adding the consumer loans to the credit cards that business has also been growing nicely.

Neha Agarwala: Just in terms of the asset quality trends that you are seeing in Mexico.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Sorry, could you repeat the question, please?

Neha Agarwala: Asset quality trends for both the consumer lending and the credit card book in Mexico. Is it better than Brazil? Has it been improving? Or are you cautious there? Thank you.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: It has been, remained fairly stable. The profitability has continued to be good.

Neha Agarwala: Thank you so much.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Marvin Fong of BTIG. Your line is open.

Marvin Fong: Excuse me, did you say Martin Fong? I thought you cut out there. But thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. First, I think maybe you touched on this earlier, but the Fintech take rate, I think there was some compression there, part of which was related to financing costs. And I think in prior quarters, we had thought that perhaps the take rate would fall kind of in step with funding costs. You see some spread compression there. Any thought about how you should think about that going forward? And then second question, just to touch again on the credit portfolio, the consumer loan balance fell a little bit quarter-by-quarter. So was that a function of what you were saying about Argentina and pausing there? Or was it some currency issues or any kind of highlight there? Is it sort of you're focusing more on credit card and maybe the consumer book won't have as much growth for the time being?

Ariel Szarfsztejn: I would say on the Fintech take rate, part of the impact is larger portion of our credit book coming from credit cards, which have the portion of those loans that are interest bearing are lower than in the other kind of loans. That has some impact to that. Also, on the other part of the Fintech business, when you look at our acquiring business, as we move into SMBs, they typically have slightly lower take rate, albeit with significantly larger volume. I would say those have an impact on the overall take rate. The second one you mentioned, if I got it right, was there was an impact in the credit portfolio because of the Argentina devaluation, right?

Marvin Fong: It's sort of a part of the question. I was just noticing the consumer loan kind of fell very, very slightly quarter-by-quarter. I was hypothesizing that perhaps there might be some currency impact or just or there's something else behind that.

Ariel Szarfsztejn: Yes, there was some impact for two reasons. The first one is in the fourth quarter before the elections, we were more conservative in issuing credit in Argentina. The second one is more direct, which is the currency devaluation. Since we take the portfolios at the end of the quarter, the devaluation happened throughout December and the forwarded loans portfolio we're showing in Argentina is devalued already.

Marvin Fong: Okay, understood. Thanks so much.

Operator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. Let's turn the call back over to Martin de los Santos, CFO, for any closing remarks.

Martin de los Santos: Well, thank you, everybody. As we mentioned, we are super excited with the result of the quarter that we're closing a great 2023. And we look forward to seeing you when we present results of Q1 of 2024. Thank you very much.

Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) Reports Upbeat Q4 But Stock Drops

MELI -10.38% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Latin American e-commerce and fintech company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) reported results ahead of analysts' expectations in Q4 FY2023, with revenue up 41.9% year on year to $4.26 billion. Its GAAP profit of $3.25 per share was flat year on year.

Is now the time to buy MercadoLibre? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

MercadoLibre (MELI) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:

Revenue: $4.26 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.13 billion (3.2% beat)

$4.26 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.13 billion (3.2% beat) EPS: $3.25 vs analyst estimates of $6.96 (53.3% miss)

$3.25 vs analyst estimates of $6.96 (53.3% miss) Free Cash Flow of $1.75 billion, up 114% from the previous quarter

of $1.75 billion, up 114% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 45.9%, down from 74.9% in the same quarter last year

45.9%, down from 74.9% in the same quarter last year Unique Active Users: 145 million, up 48 million year on year

145 million, up 48 million year on year Market Capitalization: $87.86 billion

Originally started as an online auction platform, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is a one-stop e-commerce marketplace and fintech platform in Latin America.

Online MarketplaceMarketplaces have existed for centuries. Where once it was a main street in a small town or a mall in the suburbs, sellers benefitted from proximity to one another because they could draw customers by offering convenience and selection. Today, a myriad of online marketplaces fulfill that same role, aggregating large customer bases, which attracts commission-paying sellers, generating flywheel scale effects that feed back into further customer acquisition.

Sales GrowthMercadoLibre's revenue growth over the last three years has been exceptional, averaging 56.8% annually. This quarter, MercadoLibre beat analysts' estimates and reported impressive 41.9% year-on-year revenue growth.

Usage Growth As an online marketplace, MercadoLibre generates revenue growth by increasing both the number of users on its platform and the average order size in dollars.

Over the last two years, MercadoLibre's daily active users, a key performance metric for the company, grew 24.6% annually to 145 million. This is fast growth for a consumer internet company.

In Q4, MercadoLibre added 48 million daily active users, translating into 49.5% year-on-year growth.

Revenue Per UserAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like MercadoLibre because it measures how much the company earns in transaction fees from each user. Furthermore, ARPU gives us unique insights as it's a function of a user's average order size and MercadoLibre's take rate, or ""cut"", on each order.

MercadoLibre's ARPU growth has been excellent over the last two years, averaging 16.8%. The company's ability to increase prices while growing its daily active users at such a fast rate reflects the strength of its platform, as its users are spending significantly more than last year. This quarter, ARPU declined 5% year on year to $29.39 per user.

Key Takeaways from MercadoLibre's Q4 Results

We were impressed by MercadoLibre's robust user growth this quarter, enabling it to beat analysts' revenue, total payment volume (TPV), and gross merchandise volume (GMV) estimates (TPV of $56.5 billion vs estimates of $49 billion, GMV of $13.5 billion vs estimates of $12.4 billion). Specifically, the company's new credit card offering for its Brazil and Mexico customers stood out, helping MercadoLibre accelerate its TPV growth to 154% year on year in Q4 vs 63% growth for the full year 2023.

Double-clicking into the commerce side of the business, two segments stood out during the quarter: Logistics and Advertising. On the logistics side, MELI delivered more items per vehicle in 2023 as customers increasingly utilized its loyalty program, MELI+ (similar to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime). The increased deliveries per vehicle boosted the company's efficiency, and it ended 2023 having shipped over 50% of all e-commerce orders in Brazil and over 80% of all e-commerce orders in Mexico. On the nascent but rapidly growing advertising side of the business, MercadoLibre added 50,000 new advertisers to its platform in 2023 and grew its advertising revenue by 70% year on year.

We think this was a great quarter that should delight shareholders, but the market is likely spooked by the company's headline numbers as its operating margin and EPS missed analysts' estimates by a wide margin. Looking under the hood, however, we can see that its lower profitability was caused by 1) non-recurring, non-cash expenses of $351 million that are mostly related to outstanding tax liabilities from a 2014 court case it had with the Brazilian federal tax authority, 2) lower Logistics segment margins as it offered more free shipping subsidies to customers in Brazil and Mexico, and 3) faster growth in its 1P commerce business (where it holds the inventory), which has lower margins than its 3P marketplace business (but is still additive to overall profit dollars).

Although the stock is down 8.1% after reporting, our analysis shows the reasons above do not impact the company's fundamentals. MELI is still operating with strength and momentum, and the stock currently trades at $1,673.99 per share."

MELI -10.38% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) unveiled its FQ4 results on Thursday following the market close.

The company’s earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter came in at $7.39, excluding items, which exceeded expectations of $7.07. Revenue stood at $4.26 billion, also better than the consensus forecast of $4.14 billion.

It reported a net profit of $165 million, flat compared to the year-ago period despite an increase in sales. This was due to a significant tax impact.

The company's net profit was affected by exceptional tax provisions in Brazil, totaling $351 million, short of the $356 million analysts had anticipated.

Excluding the tax impact, MercadoLibre's net profit for the quarter would have reached $383 million.

The online marketplace operator’s shares fell over 8% in after-hours.

Income from operations hit $240 million, or $572 million when excluding one-off expenses, while gross merchandise volume (GMV) increased 39.9% year-over-year to $13.5 billion.

“We look back on 2023 as a remarkable year in which we delivered strong top line growth, market share gains in most countries and improved operating margins, whilst continuing to invest in growth,” the company said in a statement."

By Niket Nishant and Manya Saini

(Reuters) -Reddit disclosed on Thursday that its net loss narrowed to $90.8 million and revenue growth was roughly 21% in 2023, as the social media company made its IPO filing public in the run-up to its highly anticipated planned U.S. stock market debut in March.

The initial public offering (IPO) filing comes almost two decades after Reddit's launch and will be a major test for the platform that still lags the commercial success of social media contemporaries such as Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Twitter, now known as X.

Reddit said it had an average of 73.1 million daily active users and 267.5 million weekly active users in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023. The company said over 100,000 active communities used its platform, which had 1 billion cumulative posts.

In the IPO filing, Reddit reported a narrower net loss of $90.8 million for the year ended Dec. 31 and logged revenue growth of $804 million, up from $666.7 million a year earlier.

Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources, that San Francisco-based Reddit has struck a deal with Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google to make its content available to train the search engine giant's artificial intelligence models. The contract is worth about $60 million each year, according to one of the sources.

Reddit was valued at $10 billion in a funding round in 2021 and it is unclear what valuation the company will aim for during its share sale in the coming weeks. It is expected to seek a sale of nearly 10% of its shares in the IPO, Reuters reported earlier.

The IPO filing showed CEO Steven Huffman holds Class B common stock that is issuable upon achieving a vesting condition - that Reddit attains $5-billion market capitalization valuation after the offering.

The social media firm is reportedly expected to hit the valuation target from the get-go.

GROWTH PROSPECTS

While Reddit was launched around the same time as other social media pioneers like Meta, which operates Facebook, and Twitter, its user base is far smaller than its contemporaries. Reddit's growth numbers also pale in comparison to larger social media peers as the company has struggled to successfully monetize its platform over the years.

There have also been questions about the company's approach to content moderation, which has been a sticking point with advertisers. It already faces stiff competition for advertising dollars from TikTok and Facebook.

Reddit has, however, built a loyal base among its users. Its message boards have powered several ""meme-stock"" rallies in the last few years, most notably in 2021, when retail traders teamed up to spark a meteoric surge in shares of highly shorted companies like GameStop (NYSE: ) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: ) Holdings.

Founded in 2005 by web developer Steve Huffman and entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, husband of tennis champion Serena Williams, Reddit has been backed by several marquee investors, from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz to China's tech behemoth, Tencent Holdings (OTC: ). Rapper Snoop Dogg is also an investor in the company.

Since being spun off from magazine conglomerate Conde Nast in 2011, Reddit became best known for its niche discussion groups and its users voting ""up"" or ""down"" for content other members posted.

It has made efforts in recent years to freshen its appeal among younger users through its acquisition of TikTok competitor Dubsmash in 2020.

The company, which generates its revenue primarily through advertising and also offers premium access for a monthly fee, has yet to turn a profit, Huffman said in a Reddit post last June.

It had confidentially filed for the U.S. IPO in late 2021, but tough economic conditions and the poor performance of listed technology stocks compelled it to delay the offering.

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been tapped as the lead underwriters for Reddit's IPO, which includes more than a dozen other banks."

NVIDIA (NVDA) is on track to beat Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: ) record stock market session on Thursday after its latest earnings release propelled its share price higher.

The company, which is benefitting significantly from the strong artificial intelligence demand, saw its shares surge more than 12% just after the open on Thursday, adding more than $200 billion to its market cap.

If the gains hold, it would represent the largest single-session gain in market value in history, above the $197 billion rise made by Meta at the start of the month.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s current market cap sits at over $1.8 trillion.

After the close on Wednesday, the company reported Q4 earnings of $5.16 per share, $0.55 better than the analyst estimate of $4.61. Revenue for the quarter came in at $22.1 billion versus the consensus estimate of $20.55 billion. It also guided to Q1 revenue of $24 billion, versus the consensus of $22 billion."

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Social media platform Reddit has struck a deal with Google (NASDAQ: ) to make its content available for training the search engine giant's artificial intelligence models, three people familiar with the matter said.

The contract with Alphabet-owned Google is worth about $60 million per year, according to one of the sources.

The deal underscores how Reddit, which is preparing for a high-profile stock market launch, is seeking to generate new revenue amid fierce competition for advertising dollars from the likes of TikTok and Meta Platform's Facebook (NASDAQ: ).

The sources were not authorized to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Reddit and Google declined to comment.

Bloomberg previously reported Reddit's content deal without naming the buyer.

Last year, Reddit said it would charge companies for access to its application programming interface (API) - the means by which it distributes its content. The agreement with Google is its first reported deal with a big AI company.

San Francisco-based Reddit, which has been looking at a stock float for more than three years, is preparing to make its initial public offering filing this week, which would detail its financials for the first time to potential IPO investors.

The filing could be available as early as Thursday, two of the sources said.

The company, which was valued at about $10 billion in a funding round in 2021, is seeking to sell about 10% of its shares in the offering, Reuters has previously reported.

Reddit's stock market launch would mark the first IPO of a major social media company since Pinterest (NYSE: ) floated its shares in 2019.

Makers of AI models have been busy clinching deals with content owners in recent months, aiming to diversify their training data beyond large scrapes of the internet. That practice is rife with potential copyright issues as many content creators have alleged that their content was used without permission.

Founded in 2005 by web developer Steve Huffman and entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, Reddit is known for its manifold niche discussion groups, some of which boast tens of millions of members."

By Gabriella Borter

(Reuters) -Florida's Republican-controlled legislature has passed legislation that would ban anyone under age 16 from social media platforms in a move that supporters have said would protect young people from online risks to their mental health.

The measure, which goes to the desk of Republican Governor Ron DeSantis after being passed by lawmakers on Thursday, would require social media platforms to terminate the accounts of people under 16 and use a third-party verification system to screen out those who are underage.

DeSantis, who last month expressed concern about the bill's potential infringement on privacy rights, told reporters on Friday that he had yet to review its final version. DeSantis said he believes social media is harmful for children but that parents ""could supervise"" and he was wary of a policy that would ""overrule"" parents.

""I think you've got to strike that proper balance when you're looking at these things,"" DeSantis said.

The measure was passed by Florida House of Representatives in a vote of 108-7, just hours after the state Senate gave its final approval.

Supporters have said the legislation would stem the harmful effects of social media on the well-being of children who use such platforms excessively and may experience anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses as a result.

Critics have said the bill violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections for free speech and that parents, not the government, should make decisions about the online presence of their children.

Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ: ), has opposed the legislation, saying it would limit parental discretion and raise data privacy concerns because of the personal information users would have to provide to be age-verified. Meta has said it supports federal legislation for online app stores to secure parental approval for downloads by people younger than 16.

The bill does not name any specific social media platforms, but states that its targets are social media sites that promote ""infinite scrolling,"" display reaction metrics such as likes, feature auto-play videos and have live-streaming and push notifications. It would exempt websites and apps whose main function is email, messaging or texting between a particular sender and recipient.

Florida House Speaker Paul Renner said lawmakers crafted the measure to address potential concerns about possible privacy rights violations.

""We've addressed constitutional concerns by narrowly focusing the scope of the bill on the addictive features, added enhanced anonymity provisions to the age verification process to protect user data, and incorporated meaningful penalties to hold Big Tech accountable,"" Renner, a Republican, posted on the social media platform X on Thursday.

The bill would require social media companies to permanently delete personal information collected from terminated accounts and let parents bring civil lawsuits against those failing to do so.

Utah in March 2023 became the first U.S. state to adopt laws regulating children's access to social media, followed by others including Arkansas, Louisiana, Ohio and Texas, according to a legislative analysis prepared for the Florida bill. The analysis said numerous other states were contemplating similar regulations."

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday released a new set of blueprints for making chips that it says could cut the time required to develop data center processors to less than a year.

Arm, whose underlying technology is widely used in the semiconductor industry and powers virtually every smartphone in the world, has been working to take market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) in the market for data central processors, or CPUs.

Arm, which is majority owned by Japan's SoftBank (TYO: ) Group, argues that its CPUs will become the preferred pairing with Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips in many artificial intelligence data centers, which has helped drive Arm's shares up more than 60% this year.

Arm's technology for creating data center processors is already in use by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Ampere Computing, which supplies chips to Oracle (NYSE: ). Arm on Wednesday announced a new generation of designs for the computing ""cores"" - the most central part of a data center chip.

But the larger announcement was that the cores will be offered as part of what Arm calls a ""compute subsystem."" That offering ties together the cores with other offerings from Arm into something closer to a complete chip design. Arm argues that customers can use it to go from an initial idea to a test chip in less than a year.

That's about half the time of a traditional two-year chip development cycle. Arm said that Microsoft already used the subsystem technology to design its ""Cobalt"" chip announced last year.

""That's a huge deal,"" Ryan Shrout of chip research firm Shrout Research said of cutting down development time.

Shrout said that one of the biggest challenges for traditional chip firms like Intel and AMD was keeping a steady design cadence. Now, Arm is offering to do that work for anyone willing to pay for its blueprints, even if they aren't a traditional chip company.

""It's one of the reasons why you're seeing Amazon, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft start to build their own platforms and not just build them once, but iterate on them. They're coming out with new generations relatively quickly,"" Shrout said."

(Reuters) -Meta Platforms' Oversight Board said on Thursday it would include social media platform Threads under its purview, allowing users to appeal the company's content moderation decisions.

The board said, in addition to the 130 million people using Threads, Meta will also be able to refer cases about content on the social media platform.

Board members will examine Meta's content decisions based on Instagram's community guidelines, which also apply to Threads.

""We believe we can help Threads be more transparent, take a global approach, and respect freedom of expression and other human rights,"" the Oversight Board said in a blog post.

The Oversight Board, which is funded by the social media company but run independently, was created in late 2020 to review Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Instagram's decisions on taking down or leaving up certain content.

The board's panel includes academics, rights experts and lawyers that makes rulings on whether to uphold or overturn the social media company's actions.

Meta will be able to implement policy and enforcement recommendations from board's decisions about Threads for a period of 12 months, but will not be able to implement product-specific recommendations, the board said."

The strength of the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks has driven strong mutual fund performance at the start of 2024, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note this week.

The bank explained that following a lackluster 2023, mutual funds are off to a strong start in 2024, with 46% of large-cap mutual funds beating their respective benchmarks year-to-date (YTD), higher than the typical 38% hit rate of outperformance.

""A majority of growth (55%) and value (53%) funds have outperformed their benchmarks,"" explained Goldman Sachs. ""Small-cap funds have performed especially well: 80% have beaten the YTD with the average fund over 100 bp ahead of the benchmark.""

""Effective stock selection has allowed PMs to capitalize on a wide dispersion of returns within the Magnificent 7,"" analysts added. ""While the Magnificent 7 as a group have outperformed YTD, AAPL and TSLA's underperformance provided a boost to fund performance versus benchmarks, offsetting the drag from rallies in NVDA and META.""

Goldman Sachs also notes that while the Magnificent 7 as a group has outperformed YTD, Apple's (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) underperformance provided a boost to fund performance versus benchmarks, offsetting the drag from rallies in NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: )."

KINGSTOWN, ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES (Reuters) - Police from two countries in the eastern Caribbean are investigating the possible murder of two people believed to be U.S. citizens who owned a catamaran that was hijacked by three fugitives in the waters off the island of Grenada.

The yacht's alleged owners, Kathy Brandel and Ralph Hendry, were last seen Sunday night, when three men escaped from the custody of Grenadian authorities. Police in St. Vincent and the Grenadines captured the men on Wednesday.

The Royal Grenada Police Force said in a statement released on Friday that preliminary information suggests the escaped prisoners had traveled from Grenada to St. Vincent and the Grenadines on a yacht. Investigators are now working on leads ""that suggest that the two occupants of the yacht may have been killed in the process,"" the statement said.

Authorities have yet to officially confirm Brandel and Hendry as the owners of the yacht, but the Salty Dawg Sailing Association, which the couple were members of, released a statement citing the couple as the owners.

That statement said a cruising skipper had reported their yacht, Simplicity, abandoned off of the coast of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The person ""found evidence of violence"" on the boat, it said.

The organization noted the pair were seasoned sailors who had spent the winter sailing down the eastern coast of the U.S. into the Caribbean.

""This is a very upsetting event and details are still unconfirmed by the authorities, but this does appear to be a tragic event,"" said Bob Osborn, the association's president.

""Upon inspection, it was found that the yacht had been ransacked, and it was apparent a violent act had taken place,"" according to the Caribbean Safety and Security Net (CSSN), which collects and disseminates information relating to crimes involving yachts in the region. ""Copious amounts of blood were found in the master stateroom, and the two owners were missing.""

According to data from AIS, an automatic tracking system that uses transceivers on ships, the yacht left Grenada around 10 p.m. local time on Sunday. The vessel's speed was uncharacteristically fast for the couple, known as fair-weather sailors who go exceedingly slowly, according to the Grenada Cruisers Information Facebook (NASDAQ: ) page.

Ron Mitchell, 30, Trevon Robertson, 19, and Abita Stanislaus, 25, were being held at the South Saint George Police Station in Grenada on charges of robbery with violence before their escape to St. Vincent, according to police. Mitchell also faced additional counts of rape, attempted rape, and indecent assault, police added."

Investing.com -- Nvidia shares soar following a blockbuster earnings release that added fuel to stock market euphoria around the applications of artificial intelligence. The rally pushes up the and Dow to fresh record closing highs, although futures on Friday point to a more subdued end to the trading week. Elsewhere, Reddit makes its filing for an initial public offering public.

1. Nvidia adds $277 billion in stock market value

Artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) added a staggering $277 billion in market capitalization on Thursday, setting a record for the biggest one-day jump in history.

The California-based firm's shares spiked by 16.4% to end the session at a fresh record high of $785.38, pushing up its market value to just under $2 trillion. The single-day addition in Nvidia's stock was itself bigger than the market cap of peer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and eclipsed a $196 billion jump notched by Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) earlier this month.

In total, $65 billion worth of Nvidia shares exchanged hands, making up about a fifth of all trading in S&P 500 stocks, Reuters reported.

Powering the frenzy was a 265% increase in fourth-quarter revenues at Nvidia, as well as commentary from Chief Executive Jensen Huang, who said that demand for AI is ""surging worldwide across companies, industries, and nations.""

2. Futures subdued

U.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline on Friday, pointing to a breather in the rally sparked by the bumper results from Nvidia.

By 03:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the contract, , and were all mostly unchanged.

The main averages on Wall Street -- as well as indices in Asia and Europe -- advanced on Thursday after Nvidia posted a massive spike in revenue and gave a bullish outlook for AI chip demand.

In New York, the blue-chip added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 added 2.1%, with both ended at record closing highs. The tech-heavy , meanwhile, rose by 3.0% -- its biggest single-session jump in a year and slightly under an all-time high closing level.

3. Reddit files for IPO

Reddit unveiled a narrowing loss as it filed its initial public offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday ahead of a highly-anticipated debut on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.

The firm, which was founded in 2005 on the idea of creating ""the home page of the internet,"" plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.” Reddit is aiming to launch its IPO in March, according to recent media reports.

In the filing, Reddit said that the amount of shares sold to retail investors and users on the platform would be ""significant,"" although it flagged that the participation could result in ""increased volatility"" of its market price. Typically, IPOs are mostly bought by institutional investors.

For the year ended Dec. 31, 2023, the social media company reported a loss of $1.54 a share from a loss of $2.77 a share a year earlier, as revenue, which is mainly driven by advertising sales, rose to $804M from $666M a year earlier.

4. StanChart reports 22% annual income jump

Asia-focused lender Standard Chartered (HK: ) (LON: ) clocked a stronger profit for 2023 as it benefited from higher interest rates, with the bank also announcing a $1 billion buyback.

Still, the lender downgraded its income outlook for 2024 and forecast mild increases in its net interest income, citing some economic risks from sticky inflation and potential geopolitical instability.

StanChart’s underlying profit before tax for the year to Dec. 31 rose 22% to $5.68 billion, the group said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its underlying net interest income rose 20% to $9.56 billion for the year.

5. Oil prices dip

Oil prices were lower in European trade on Friday, and were set to close the week a shade lower as concerns over sluggish demand largely offset bets on tighter supplies linked to disruptions in the Middle East.

A string of weak economic readings from across the globe spurred more concerns over slowing demand, especially after data released last week showed the U.K. and Japan both entering recessions in the fourth quarter.

Expectations of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates also weighed on the outlook for demand in the world's largest oil consumer, as several signals from the Federal Reserve showed the bank was in no hurry to begin trimming interest rates.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) saw its shares soar more than 15% on Thursday following the chipmaker’s yet another blockbuster quarterly report and better-than-anticipated revenue guidance.

According to the financial data firm S3 Partners, this one-day gain cost short sellers roughly $2.9 billion.

NVDA stands as the most heavily shorted entity in the semiconductor sector, with short interest totaling $18.3 billion.

This places it third among the largest short positions in the U.S., trailing only behind Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) at $20.17 billion and Apple (NASDAQ: ) at $18.72 billion.

“Over the last thirty days we’ve seen Semiconductor sector short interest increase by $1.9 billion to $59.5 billion of total short interest,” S3 noted in a Thursday report.

“Today’s Semiconductor rally, driven by NVDA’s blowout earnings, has produced an AI generated nightmare for short sellers as they are down $4.3 billion in one day mark-to-market losses, down -7.26%. Nearly two-thirds of these losses were the $2.8 billion of losses for NVDA shorts,” it added.

For the month of February, those shorting the semiconductor sector have incurred losses of $7.2 billion, translating to a 12.00% decrease, and a year-to-date loss of $9.7 billion, or -16.8%.

This makes the Semiconductor industry the most negatively impacted sector in terms of short-selling performance for the year so far, S3 highlighted.

For comparison, the Interactive Media & Services sector is down $4.5 billion, while the Biotechnology and the Pharmaceutical sectors saw declines of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively."

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) identified Huawei as a top competitor in several categories, including artificial intelligence chips, for the first time in a filing with the Securities and Exchange commission late Wednesday.

The Santa Clara, California-based company said that China's Huawei competes in supplying chips designed for artificial intelligence such as graphics processing units (GPUs), central processing units (CPUs) and networking chips. The company also identified Huawei as a cloud service company designing its own hardware and software to improve AI computing.

Nvidia declined to comment on Thursday.

Huawei developed the Ascend series of chips as a rival to Nvidia's line of AI chips. The Chinese company's main product, the 910B chip, is its main rival to Nvidia's A100 chip, which launched roughly three years ago.

Analysts have estimated China's AI chip market to be worth $7 billion.

Last year, Reuters reported that Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ: ) placed a chip order with Huawei ahead of widely anticipated new rules by the U.S. government tightened restrictions on advanced AI chips exported to China.

Other rivals pointed out by Nvidia include Intel (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ). The chip company also identified several large cloud computing companies such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: )

Nvidia shares surged 14% in early afternoon trading on Thursday after the company issued a revenue forecast that topped consensus estimates as strong demand for AI continues."

CMB International Capital Corp. initiated research coverage on the technological behemoths Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) with a Buy rating.

For MSFT, CMB analysts believe the Windows maker remains the “consensus AI thematic pick” among global tech stocks thanks to its “cohesive product portfolio, exclusive partnership with OpenAI” and vast consumer and business customer bases, among other things.

“We are constructive on Microsoft’s long-term growth potential, and believe that Microsoft is poised for further market share gains for all its key product portfolio with the empowerment of generative AI,” wrote analysts.

CMB projects an annual revenue growth rate of 21% for Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud (IC) segment from fiscal year 2023 to 2026.

Within this segment, it anticipates Azure's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%, fueled by a rise in user engagement and a significant increase in revenue generation from AI Cloud services.

“With the ramp-up of revenue generation from gen-AI and copilot, we are forecasting a FY23-26E total revenue CAGR of 15.8%, with total revenue to reach US$329.3bn in FY26, versus a revenue CAGR of 14.0% over FY20-23,” they said.

CMB set a target price of $473.60 for MSFT.

As for AMZN, the investment firm sees “ample potential” for the company’s e-commerce business in both the US and internationally.

Simultaneously, Amazon’s AWS cloud unit is supported by robust technological infrastructure, and the advent of generative AI presents additional growth prospects, CMB analysts said in the note.

“The continuous increase in retail business efficiency and improvement in economies of scale will help boost profitability in our view, backed by regionalization strategy, reduction in cost to serve, and rising revenue contribution from platform business,” they noted.

“Increase in revenue mix of relatively high-margin AWS business is likely to drive margin expansion for Amazon in the long run.”

CMB’s target price for AMZN sits at $213 per share."

By Stephen Nellis

(Reuters) - Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday released a new set of blueprints for making chips that it says could cut the time required to develop data center processors to less than a year.

Arm, whose underlying technology is widely used in the semiconductor industry and powers virtually every smartphone in the world, has been working to take market share away from Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) in the market for data central processors, or CPUs.

Arm, which is majority owned by Japan's SoftBank (TYO: ) Group, argues that its CPUs will become the preferred pairing with Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips in many artificial intelligence data centers, which has helped drive Arm's shares up more than 60% this year.

Arm's technology for creating data center processors is already in use by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Ampere Computing, which supplies chips to Oracle (NYSE: ). Arm on Wednesday announced a new generation of designs for the computing ""cores"" - the most central part of a data center chip.

But the larger announcement was that the cores will be offered as part of what Arm calls a ""compute subsystem."" That offering ties together the cores with other offerings from Arm into something closer to a complete chip design. Arm argues that customers can use it to go from an initial idea to a test chip in less than a year.

That's about half the time of a traditional two-year chip development cycle. Arm said that Microsoft already used the subsystem technology to design its ""Cobalt"" chip announced last year.

""That's a huge deal,"" Ryan Shrout of chip research firm Shrout Research said of cutting down development time.

Shrout said that one of the biggest challenges for traditional chip firms like Intel and AMD was keeping a steady design cadence. Now, Arm is offering to do that work for anyone willing to pay for its blueprints, even if they aren't a traditional chip company.

""It's one of the reasons why you're seeing Amazon, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft start to build their own platforms and not just build them once, but iterate on them. They're coming out with new generations relatively quickly,"" Shrout said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors poured cash into money market funds at the fastest pace on record in the first weeks of the year, and funnelled another $15 billion into equities in the week to Wednesday, Bank of America Global Research said on Friday.

The BofA report showed the equity market rally is broadening beyond the mega caps, as U.S. small cap funds logged their largest weekly inflow in the week to Wednesday since June 2022, at $5.1 billion.

BofA said in its weekly roundup of fund flows in and out of world markets citing EPFR data, that flows to cash were running at an annualised rate of $1.3 trillion in the first weeks of 2024 through to Feb. 21.

Investors can often opt for cash when they are less confident, but with interest rates at elevated levels and looking less likely to drop in the very near term, cash-equivalent money market funds have drawn in flows.

In the latest week, as the hit record highs, investors put $15.2 billion into bonds, including $10.2 billion into investment-grade bond funds, which logged a 16th straight week of inflows, the longest such stretch since October 2021, BofA said.

The S&P this month topped the 5,000-mark for the first time ever, thanks to a surge in the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" most valuable stocks that include the likes of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

BofA's ""Bull & Bear"" indicator remained at 6.6 for the latest week, tilting into ""bullish territory"", but the bank said this was not overly stretched.

On a scale up to 10, a reading above 6 is straying into bullish territory and below 5 is moving into bearish territory.

""Positioning (is) not yet at extreme bullish, but (it) won't take too long,"" BofA said in the report.

Last week was also the first time since September that both energy and raw materials funds registered a weekly inflow, according to the report."

Jeff Bezos, Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and several other leading technology companies are investing in Figure AI Inc., a startup focused on developing human-like robots, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

The company, which also enjoys backing from OpenAI and Microsoft Corp . (NASDAQ: ), is in the process of raising approximately $675 million in a funding round, giving it a pre-money valuation of approximately $2 billion.

Bezos, through Explore Investments LLC, is contributing $100 million, with Microsoft adding $95 million. Nvidia and an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). affiliate fund are each investing $50 million.

This investment reflects the technology sector's growing interest in robots as a way to apply advanced AI in practical settings. Figure AI is reportedly working on Figure 01, a robot designed to mimic human appearance and movement, aiming to undertake hazardous tasks and address labor shortages.

The round also sees contributions from Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ).’s venture arm with $25 million, LG Innotek with $8.5 million, and Samsung’s investment group with $5 million. Additional support comes from venture firms Parkway Venture Capital and Align Ventures, contributing $100 million and $90 million, respectively.

OpenAI, which previously explored an acquisition of Figure, is participating with a $5 million investment.

The interest from such significant players has spurred further investment, pushing the total amount raised notably above the $500 million that Figure initially targeted.

The latest funding round comes after the robot maker secured $70 million last May, in a round led by Parkway Venture Capital."

(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.

Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google (NASDAQ: ).

That has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

Nvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.

The shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the 's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.

Its latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.

The breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.

""I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,"" said one investor, who declined to be named.

Despite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.

""Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,"" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.

""We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online."""
Microsoft,Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Soaring Today,2024-02-22,11:22,AM,"Published Feb 22, 2024 11:22AM ET Updated Feb 22, 2024 11:30AM ET

Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Soaring Today

NVDA +0.36% Add to/Remove from Watchlist AMD -2.94% Add to/Remove from Watchlist MSFT -0.32% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

What Happened: Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ: ) jumped 10.9% in the morning session as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.

Nvidia's guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations.

Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.

Is now the time to buy AMD? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

What is the market telling us: AMD's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 22 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for AMD and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 22 days ago, when the stock dropped 7.4% on the news that the company provided fourth-quarter results with revenue guidance for the next quarter falling below Wall Street's expectations.

Specifically, the Data Center segment is expected to see flat sequential growth with ""the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp."" Management provided additional color on the server market during the earnings call, ""So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on, as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious...""

Despite this uncertainty, there were some positive points during the quarter. Revenue growth in the Data Center and Client segments more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded units, leading to a slight topline beat. On the AI front, management hesitated to provide market share projections, suggesting it is still early days. However, it reiterated the market estimate for the Data Center AI accelerator business growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. In addition, the company highlighted its production of AI GPUs (MI300X) to meet growing demand from major players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ). With the AI GPU business expected to surpass $3.5 billion in 2024, there's certainly momentum in this area.

Overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company, which likely didn't deliver the level of optimism expected by the market, especially considering the growing wave of investors excited about the new AI prospects and expecting AMD to be a top player in the GPU market.

AMD is up 32.1% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $7,516."

By Eric Onstad and Paul Lienert

LONDON/DETROIT (Reuters) -Volkswagen, whose drive to develop a ""solid-state"" electric car battery with U.S. startup QuantumScape has been dogged by delays, is casting its net wider in pursuit of the potentially game-changing technology.

The German auto giant is holding talks with France's Blue Solutions, which already produces solid-state batteries for Daimler (OTC: ) electric buses, about adapting the design for cars, a source with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

VW and Blue Solutions aim to reach a joint development agreement in the coming months, according to the source who asked not to be identified as the talks are private.

Volkswagen (ETR: )'s move to widen its options in the field points to the array of technical hurdles holding back wider development of solid-state technology, seen by its backers as the ""holy grail"" of EV batteries, promising longer driving ranges and shorter charging times than traditional lithium-ion packs.

VW said its venture with QuantumScape was on track and declined to comment when asked about any discussions with Blue Solutions.

A spokesperson for Blue Solutions, a unit of French conglomerate Bollore, confirmed that it was working on a battery for passenger cars and said it had signed development deals with BMW (ETR: ) and another company, and was in talks with a third, but declined to identify the others.

VW, Toyota (NYSE: ), BMW and other global automakers are vying to crack the conundrum of solid-state batteries, which remain technically elusive despite decades of research and billions of dollars of investment.

""A lot of promises haven't been delivered and several automakers and investors have been burnt,"" said Rory McNulty at consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. ""There's loads of really good verified data and technology, but can they (the industry) do it reliably, at scale?""

Blue Solutions, for its part, faces stiff challenges to radically bring down the four-hour charging time required by its current batteries, which is feasible for buses parked overnight in depots. The company's spokesperson told Reuters it was working on a passenger car battery with a charging time of 20 minutes, and aimed to construct a ""gigafactory"" for it by 2029.

The sector's lack of commercial success has dampened market enthusiasm; the amount of global venture capital deal activity in solid-state battery companies fell 72% last year to $146 million, according to data from PitchBook.

""Investor interest in solid state batteries has waned. They are questioning whether the risk of solid state is worth it,"" Ibex Investors partner Jeff Peters said.

QUANTUMSCAPE: STILL A LOT OF WORK

Solid state ideally envisions replacing the liquid electrolyte though which the electrical charge passes in lithium-ion EV batteries with a solid substitute, thus reducing a fire hazard and shrinking the size of battery packs, and using lithium metal for its negative terminal to boost performance.

Gauging precisely the right combination of chemicals and materials so they don't react adversely with each other is a minefield, though.

QuantumScape's venture with its top shareholder VW, which has invested $300 million in the startup, is an example how solid-state technology has failed to live up to its initial promise.

The development deal signed in 2018 envisaged solid-state powering Volkswagen EVs by 2025, enabling the e-Golf to more than double its range to 750 km. When QuantumScape subsequently went public via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company in New York in 2020, it said it was aiming for commercial battery production in 2024.

Yet mass commercial production remains a distant prospect, even after QuantumScape shipped its first prototypes to VW and other prospective customers in late 2022, the start of what is typically a multi-year process of testing and certification.

Furthermore, the battery isn't pure solid state; it uses a liquid electrolyte with ceramic separating the positive and negative terminals.

""We still have a lot of work to do,"" QuantumScape's CEO Jagdeep Singh told Reuters. ""The prototype is meant to show the core functionality is there, not that the cell is fully ironed out in terms of all the different defects that can be introduced during the production process.""

QuantumScape's shares, which hit a peak of $132.70 in December 2020, have since sunk to $7.37, giving the company a market value of about $3.6 billion. It has not said when it expects high-volume commercial production. Goldman Sachs said this was likely in the latter part of the decade.

QuantumScape said in a regulatory filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last October that it had missed commercialization timeline milestones envisaged in the 2018 deal with VW, and that the German automaker thus had the right to terminate the joint venture should it choose to.

TOYOTA FLAGS BREAKTHROUGH

Volkswagen and QuantumScape aren't the only players that have pared their ambitions as they grapple with the technical complexities of solid state.

Toyota, the world's biggest automaker ahead of VW, had targeted a 2025 production startup date for its solid-state batteries, but said in June it now does not expect to produce the cells at scale before 2027 or 2028.

The Japanese company nonetheless said it had achieved a technical breakthrough, without providing details beyond a projected driving range of 750 miles or more and charging time of 10 minutes.

Several other companies have plans to roll out solid-state batteries including Chinese battery leader CATL, LG Energy Solution, Solid Power, ProLogium, Honda (NYSE: ) and Nissan (OTC: ). (see accompanying FACTBOX)

EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ) is an industry outlier in not having detailed any solid-state battery development plans.

A key issue solid-state scientists have been grappling with is the impact of introducing lithium metal for the anode.

Lithium metal can dramatically lift performance, but often sparks reactions with the solid compounds, including creating dendrites, spiky formations that create cracks and imperfections and can ultimately short-circuit a battery.

Battery makers, automakers and researchers have tried using a variety of substances for the solid electrolyte in three main categories: polymers, sulfides and oxides.

Some companies have already rolled out partial versions of solid-state batteries that offer some benefits of the technology. China's EV firms Nio (NYSE: ) and Seres have both launched EV models with ""semi-solid-state"" batteries which have both solid and gel-like electrolyte components but do not use lithium metal anodes."

NIO -7.69% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Thursday, JPMorgan downgraded shares of electric vehicle maker NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), shifting its rating from Neutral to Underweight. The financial institution also reduced its price target for the company's stock to $5.00, a decrease from the previous $8.50 target. This adjustment comes in response to NIO's stock performance, which has seen a 34% decline year-to-date (YTD), lagging behind the broader Chinese auto market's 18% drop and the MXCN's 5% dip.

The downgrade was prompted by NIO's slower sales in January and growing investor worries about the company's sales and earnings momentum going into 2024. JPMorgan's revised revenue forecast for NIO in 2024 is approximately 10% below the Street consensus, as reported by Bloomberg, suggesting that the market's sales volume forecast of 220-240K units is optimistic compared to JPMorgan's projection of 191K units.

JPMorgan highlighted that NIO's sales momentum faces challenges, noting the company's plan to release only one new model targeting the mass market segment under its new Alps brand this year. This model is expected to be priced between Rmb200-300K and is likely to contribute to sales mainly in the fourth quarter of 2024, limiting its impact on the company's overall business for the year. The firm also pointed to the intensifying competition in the mass market from peers such as XPeng (NYSE: ), BYD (SZ: ), Geely, and Great Wall, as well as the anticipated entry of Xiaomi (OTC: ) into the sector.

On a positive note, NIO has been working on streamlining expenses and saving costs. In the second half of 2023, the company strategically reduced sales discounts to protect its average selling price and margins. JPMorgan expects NIO to maintain its focus on expense and cost discipline throughout the current year. Additionally, the company plans to update its existing product portfolio starting in the second quarter of 2024.

Technological advancements are also on NIO's agenda, with the continued rollout of its Navigation on Pilot (NOP) service to more cities across China, which could enhance the attractiveness of its products. Following new Chinese government policies allowing vehicles to be equipped with Level 3 semi-autonomous driving functions from 2024, it is anticipated that most new New Energy Vehicle (NEV) models will feature Level 3 capabilities.

JPMorgan's downgrade reflects a cautious stance on NIO's ability to maintain sales and earnings momentum in a highly competitive market, and the firm suggests that consensus forecasts may face potential downside risks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Solid-state batteries hold the promise of more energy storage, longer driving ranges and faster charging for next-generation electric vehicles. Yet despite decades of research and billions of dollars invested, their future still looks elusive.

Here are some of the companies developing these kind of batteries. EV market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ), an industry outlier, has not detailed any solid-state development plans.

U.S. startup QuantumScape, which has deals with six automakers including Volkswagen (ETR: ), has developed a semi-solid state cell with no anode that uses lithium metal, a ceramic separator and liquid electrolyte. The company says it could boost an EV's driving range from 350 miles to 400-500 miles, an increase of 14%-43%. The expected range increase is down from earlier estimates of 50%-80%.

QuantumScape shipped its first prototype samples in late 2022, which VW said showed the battery could drive more than 500,000 miles without any noticeable loss of range and had a fast charging time to 80% capacity in 15 minutes.

France's Blue Solutions is already selling solid state batteries for buses with a charging time of four hours, but is developing a new product for cars that uses a polymer electrolyte and ultra-thin lithium metal anode, aiming to have a charging time of less than 20 minutes and enabling a range increase of about 30% to nearly 1,000 km.

The company says it aims to build a gigafactory for its new batteries by 2029 and has signed a joint development agreement with BMW (ETR: ).

Toyota (NYSE: ), the world's biggest automaker, said in June it had achieved a breakthrough in solid-state technology that addressed durability problems. It said it planned commercialisation in 2027-2028 of a battery with a range of 1,000 km and a charging time of 10 minutes.

ProLogium Technology of Taiwan said that by the end of 2023 it aimed to ship prototype samples of its semi-solid-state batteries that enable a near doubling of the energy densities of the packs.

The firm, which has a cooperation deal with Mercedes-Benz (OTC: ), Stellantis (NYSE: ) and TotalEnergies (EPA: ), is building a gigafactory in Taiwan and plans one in France.

Chinese EV maker Nio (NYSE: ) has commercialized 150 kilowatt hour (kWh) semi-solid-state batteries for its EVs, manufactured by Beijing Welion New Energy, which have a range of up to 1,000 km. Nio sells EVs in China and Europe and operates a battery-swapping service for its vehicles.

Ganfeng LiEnergy, a subsidiary of Ganfeng Lithium, is producing semi-solid-state batteries that power EVs produced by China's Seres, such as the Seres 5 SUV which has a range of 530 km, with a fast charge time of 50 minutes.

China's CATL, one of the world's biggest battery producers, last year unveiled a condensed matter battery, a type of semi-solid-state battery it said could supply enough energy to power electric passenger aircraft. It had said it could start mass production of the batteries for EVs later in 2023, though hasn't provided an update on this.

U.S. startup Solid Power delivered test cells of its semi-solid state battery with a sulfide-based solid electrolyte and a high-content silicon anode to BMW late last year. It is also in the early stages of developing a battery with a lithium metal anode. Ford (NYSE: ), BMW, Hyundai (OTC: ) and SK Innovation have invested in the company.

Another American player, Factorial Energy, delivered prototype samples of its semi-solid state battery to automaker partners last year for testing. The startup, which aims for a battery range of 600 miles, has agreements with Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Hyundai.

South Korea's LG Energy Solution said last year it aimed to develop polymer-based and sulfide-based solid state batteries by 2026 and 2030 respectively.

South Korea's SK On, the battery unit of energy group SK Innovation, is developing two types of solid-state cells - high-molecular-oxide composite batteries and sulfide-based batteries - aiming to produce prototypes by 2026 and commercialize them by 2028.

South Korea's Samsung (KS: ) SDI is developing a solid-state battery without an anode and launched production of prototypes last year ahead of expected mass production in 2027.

Honda (NYSE: ) plans to launch a solid-state battery test line in 2024, aiming to use the batteries in models in the latter part of this decade. It also invested in SES AI to jointly develop semi-solid state batteries.

Nissan (OTC: ) plans to launch an EV a pure solid-state battery developed in-house by its fiscal year 2028."

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng (NYSE: ) said it would hire 4,000 this year and invest millions in artificial intelligence, as it seeks to survive what it describes as a ""bloody sea"" of competition in the world's largest auto market.

The additional employees would represent a 25% expansion of the Volkswagen-backed EV maker's workforce from the latest headcount of 15,829 at the end of 2022.

The expansion was announced in a letter from Chief Executive He Xiaopeng to employees on Sunday, the first working day after the Lunar New Year holiday.

The company will also invest 3.5 billion yuan ($486.36 million) in AI research and development for intelligent driving, He said, adding that Xpeng plans to release around 30 new products or revised models within three years.

""Facing the pessimistic macroeconomic situation, many business partners are drawing back and afraid to invest. I think this is an opportunity for our development,"" He said, describing 2024 as the first year of the ""knockout round"" for Chinese auto brands. ""In 2024, we will buck the trend and enter a high-speed positive cycle in the fourth quarter or earlier.""

Xpeng's expansion plans contrast with rivals, which are racing to slash costs. Demand continues to falter in the world's largest auto market despite renewed discounting led by Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Nio (NYSE: ), another Chinese EV maker, said in November it would trim its workforce by 10% to improve efficiency amid growing competition.

Facing weaker demand at home, automakers in China have looked to exports as a driving force for growth. But China's growing clout as a vehicle exporter is causing frictions abroad.

China's commerce ministry said earlier this month that it would encourage the new energy vehicle industry to respond to foreign trade restrictions and cooperate with overseas firms, amid a European probe into Chinese subsidies for the sector.

Volkswagen (ETR: ) said in July that it would invest around $700 million in Xpeng and purchase a 4.99% stake in the company.

""This year is Xpeng's 10th year. Our performance must more than double,"" He said.

NIO -7.69% Add to/Remove from Watchlist TSLA -2.76% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Chinese electric vehicle company NIO (NYSE: ) saw its shares fall a further 2% Thursday, adding to its recent decline, which has seen the stock tumble towards lows not seen since 2020.

Why Nio stock is falling (near 4-year lows)

Despite a push higher in 2023 until August, the electric vehicle maker has struggled to see any upside due to various headwinds impacting the business, including supply issues and demand concerns.

In recent days, the weak production forecasts for other electric vehicle companies have also weighed on the stock.

Back in November, Nio announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce amid ""fierce competition,"" while since late 2022, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has repeatedly cut prices in China, leading other manufacturers in the country to respond. This resulted in profit margins being squeezed.

Furthermore, the weakness in NIO's stock price can be attributed to the company's slow sales in January and concerns regarding the company's sales and earnings momentum in 2024 this year.

JPMorgan downgrades Nio stock

In a note focusing on the Chinese auto industry, JPMorgan analysts downgrade NIO to Underweight from Neutral on Friday, noting the low earnings visibility across the sector.

The bank explained that it sees downside to consensus volume/revenue estimates, while it noted that the lack of new models relative to peers may further weigh on its stock performance.

JPMorgan also highlighted that competition in the mass market may only intensify, ""especially considering the number of new launches from peers such as XPeng (NYSE: ), BYD (SZ: ), Geely (OTC: ) (Galaxy and Zeekr brands) and Great Wall.""

Nio stock forecast

Looking ahead, JPMorgan sees NIO shares hitting $5 per share after cutting the price target from $8.50 in the note.

""For 2024, our revised revenue forecast (Rmb73bn) is about 10% below Street consensus, as per Bloomberg,"" the bank stated. ""This implies that the Street's sales volume forecast would be around 220-240K units, higher than our 191K units.""

Meanfirm's Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that they remain Overweight on NIO and see it reaching $13 per share.

The investment bank believes execution still holds the key to turning the tide for the stock.

""Investors are likely to pay close attention to how NIO leverages the upsized sales team to regain growth impetus during a window period in 1H24 before the launch of its sub-brand ALPS in 2H24,"" stated the firm. ""Battery swapping and NOP+ADAS development will also be key focus areas in 2024."""

Investing.com-- Shares of major Chinese electric vehicle makers fell sharply on Thursday as weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) ramped up concerns over a slowdown in global demand.

A warning from Tesla CEO Elon Musk- that Chinese EV makers would “demolish” their foreign rivals without trade barriers, also fed into fears of eventual export restrictions on the sector.

Hong Kong shares of Chinese EV makers NIO Inc (HK: ), Li Auto (NASDAQ: ) Inc (HK: ) and Xpeng (NYSE: ) Inc (HK: ) sank between 5% and 8%, while those of BYD (HK: ), which is a key competitor of Tesla, fell 3.5%.

Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (SZ: ), which is a key battery supplier for Tesla, sank 1.4% in Shenzhen trade.

The declines came tracking a 3% fall in Tesla in aftermarket trade, after the world’s most valuable carmaker clocked weaker-than-expected EPS for the fourth quarter, following a series of price cuts over the past year.

The firm warned that sales growth will be “notably lower” in 2024 from the prior year, especially as it works on the development of a new generation of EVs. Tesla also faced increased regulatory scrutiny in China amid souring relations between the world's largest economies.

EV demand fears rise, China competition to heat up

But Tesla’s weak outlook fed into concerns that global demand for EVs was slowing, especially after a recent research report showed that a reduction in state subsidies and market saturation was expected to dent sales growth in 2024.

Traditional automakers including General Motors Company (NYSE: ) and Ford (NYSE: ) were recently seen scaling back production plans for EVs in the face of potentially weaker demand, while hybrid vehicles, which- which use both electric motors and traditional combustion engines- are seeing a resurgence in demand.

While China is expected to remain a key driver of EV demand in the coming year, falling sales in the rest of the globe are expected to ramp up competition in the country.

Tesla had started a bitter price war in the country over the past year, as price cuts by the EV maker spurred similar measures by its peers. This resulted in weakening margins across the sector.

Analysts said that Tesla was unlikely to ease up with its price cuts, especially in the face of weakening demand and increased competition. This likely presents more margin pressure on EV makers.

“Flat sales and substantially reduced margin results are further evidence that Tesla is losing its leadership advantage and its brand leadership has weakened,"" Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand told Reuters.

Increased competition may also see Tesla lose its market dominance in the EV sector. Chinese rival BYD sold more EVs globally than Tesla in the fourth quarter, with the former also making forays into the growing Indian market well ahead of Tesla.

To alleviate the capex associated with battery swapping, NIO expanded its collaborative efforts. After partnering with Changan, the company entered into strategic agreements with JAC and Chery in January. Further collaborations are anticipated, aiming to mitigate NIO's capex responsibilities.

Attention from investors will likely be directed towards NIO's utilization of an expanded sales team to reinvigorate growth in the first half of 2024, ahead of the ALPS sub-brand launch in the second half of the year. Battery swapping initiatives and the development of NOP+ADAS will also remain focal points for NIO throughout 2024.

Shares of NIO are up 2.67% in pre-market trading Thursday morning."

(Reuters) - A staggering rise in shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) helped the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX: ) become the first exchange traded fund to top $500 billion in assets, market participants said.

The largest and most liquid fund tracking the index topped $500 billion on Thursday, according to its issuer, State Street (NYSE: ) Global Advisors. It currently has about $502 billion in assets.

A sizeable chunk of those gains came from the surge in Nvidia, whose heavy weighting in the S&P 500 gives it an outsized influence on the index’s moves. The stock’s shares have soared nearly 60% year-to-date, adding another 8.9% in the last week alone, thanks to a post-earnings surge on Thursday.

“This is a result of Nvidia climbing to new highs rather than of fresh demand for the ETF,” said Todd Rosenbluth, chief ETF strategist at VettaFi.

Nvidia, one of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks that have helped drive markets higher this year, has a weighting of 4.5% in the S&P 500. The index is up 6.7% year-to-date.

The company briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on an insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

While the SPDR ETF continues to dominate trading volumes and liquidity and topped the list of ETFs with the largest inflows last year, two other broad market ETFs have emerged as challengers in recent years.

Flows into both BlackRock Inc (NYSE: ).'s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF have grown at a faster rate over the last three years as a whole, data from LSEG showed.

Together, the three ETFs now account for about $1.35 trillion of the $8.4 trillion of total assets invested in ETFs in the U.S. Rosenbluth noted."

Investing.com-- The Dow and S&P 500 notched a record close Friday, even as the rally in Nvidia cooled to blunt the broader tech sector's swashbuckling gains amid waning optimism for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.

By 16:00 ET (21:40 GMT), the closed 62 points, or 0.2%, eked out gains to close at a fresh record of 5,088.85, while fell 0.3%. The three major averages closed up for the week, rising more than 1%.

Nvidia briefly joins $2 trillion club as climb continues

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) gave up the bulk of its gains to close just above the flatline after briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time, having added $277 billion in stock market value the previous day, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings saw investors largely trade past warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates will stay higher for longer- a notion that was further reinforced by stronger-than-expected jobless claims data.

The gains in Nvidia helped keep losses in the broader semiconductor index in check after Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: ) gave up some gains from a day earlier.

Fed speak continues to weigh on rate-cut bets

Investors continued to rein in their expectations for aggressive rate cuts, following fresh remarks from Federal Reserve officials that point to a prolonged higher-for-longer interest-rate regime.

Federal Reserve Board Governor said on Thursday that he was in ""no rush"" to lower rates. A slew of Fed members have previously echoed this notion, citing fears of sticky inflation and strength in the labor market.

Traders are now expecting the first rate cut in June rather than May, with just four rate cuts expected, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that they no longer think the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to slash interest rates at its policy meeting in May following Waller's comments, now expecting the Fed to roll out its first 25 basis-point cut in June.

Warner Bros Discovery slumps after quarterly loss; Carvana , Block shine on earnings stage

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped more than 9% after the media giant reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Friday, as the media conglomerate battled a weak advertising market and the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.

Carvana (NYSE: ) jumped 31% after the used car company narrowed quarterly losses and forecast core earnings well above $100 million in the first quarter,

The company ""continues to show outsized GPU improvement and is giving bulls hope of being on the doorstep of a bigger return to volume growth,"" RBC said in a note as it upgraded its price target on the company to $45 from $24.

Payments firm Block (NYSE: ) gained 16% after it beat quarterly revenue estimates and hiked its annual operating profit outlook, driven by strong performance in its Cash App as margins improved.

Block ""sharpening its focus within its two key businesses Square and Cash App, and becoming hyper-focused on driving profitable growth has been impressive - and we think there's more to go,"" Seaport said Friday after upgrading its rating on the stock to buy from neutral.

Intuitive Machines soars as moon touch down sparks rally; RIVN remains in reverse after UBS double downgrade

Aerospace firm Intuitive Machines (NASDAQ: ) rallied nearly 16% after its Odysseus lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon, becoming the first private craft to do so and the first U.S. craft on the moon since 1972.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, fell 12% to add to its losses from a day earlier after UBS slapped a sell rating on the stock, marking a double downgrade form a buy on worries of waning EV demand.

""A changing EV backdrop causes us to reassess our demand view and makes RIVN’s current strategy quite onerous on the ramp to profitability and cash flow,"" UBS said in a note.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong corporate results have helped fuel the S&P 500’s climb to new highs this year, taking the focus away from the Federal Reserve’s tortuous path towards lower interest rates. As earnings season winds down, some investors believe monetary policy will jump back in the driver's seat.

Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: )'s blockbuster earnings results put an exclamation point on the fourth-quarter reporting period, as the AI darling's surging shares propelled the to fresh record highs in the past week. The benchmark index has gained over 6.7% so far this year.

With the vast majority having reported, S&P 500 companies were on track to increase fourth-quarter earnings by 10% from the year-earlier period, according to LSEG IBES data, which would be the biggest rise since the first quarter of 2022.

As the earnings glow fades in coming weeks, the spotlight could turn back to the macroeconomic picture. One pivotal factor could be the steady rise in bond yields, which has come on the heels of shrinking expectations for how much the Fed can ease monetary policy this year without reigniting inflation.

""The market has been able to ignore the rise in yields because of the strong earnings,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""That focus on the path of rates and yields might come back into the forefront as we move past earnings season.""

Higher yields on Treasuries tend to pressure equity valuations as they increase the appeal of bonds over stocks while raising the cost of capital for companies and households. The benchmark , which moves inversely to bond prices, hit 4.35% earlier this week, its highest level since late November.

While optimism on earnings and the economy has helped stocks shrug off the climb in yields, this could change if inflation data keeps coming in stickier than expected, forcing the Fed to further delay rate cuts.

Futures tied to the Fed’s main policy rate on Friday showed investors pricing in around 80 basis points of Fed cuts this year, compared to 150 basis points they had priced in early January.

An inflation test arrives Thursday, with the release of January's personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed tracks for its inflation targets. On a monthly basis, the PCE index is expected to increase 0.3%, according to a Reuters poll of economists, up from a 0.2% rise the prior month.

""If inflation renews its downward trend, that is going to be helpful to interest rates and that can provide the next catalyst for an up move"" in stocks, said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.

At the same time, many investors believe AI fervor will continue driving stocks for the foreseeable future. Nvidia touched $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on an insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

“We believe retaining strategic exposure to the US large-cap technology sector is important, and the rise in tech stocks could go further still,” wrote analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management on Friday, adding that they believe generative AI “will prove to be the growth theme of the decade.”

Next week will also bring other data including on consumer confidence and durable goods that will give a broader look into the state of the economy. A number of the companies due to report results in the coming week, including Lowe's (NYSE: ) and Best Buy (NYSE: ), are retailers who will give insight into consumer spending.

Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, is among the investors who see benefits if the economy continues walking a fine line to a so-called “soft landing,” in which the Fed is able to cool inflation without upending growth.

""If we can get slowing growth, slowing inflation, create an environment that the Fed can start reducing interest rates... that should help the average stock,"" he said."

Jeff Bezos, Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and several other leading technology companies are investing in Figure AI Inc., a startup focused on developing human-like robots, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

The company, which also enjoys backing from OpenAI and Microsoft Corp . (NASDAQ: ), is in the process of raising approximately $675 million in a funding round, giving it a pre-money valuation of approximately $2 billion.

Bezos, through Explore Investments LLC, is contributing $100 million, with Microsoft adding $95 million. Nvidia and an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). affiliate fund are each investing $50 million.

This investment reflects the technology sector's growing interest in robots as a way to apply advanced AI in practical settings. Figure AI is reportedly working on Figure 01, a robot designed to mimic human appearance and movement, aiming to undertake hazardous tasks and address labor shortages.

The round also sees contributions from Intel Corp (NASDAQ: ).’s venture arm with $25 million, LG Innotek with $8.5 million, and Samsung’s investment group with $5 million. Additional support comes from venture firms Parkway Venture Capital and Align Ventures, contributing $100 million and $90 million, respectively.

OpenAI, which previously explored an acquisition of Figure, is participating with a $5 million investment.

The interest from such significant players has spurred further investment, pushing the total amount raised notably above the $500 million that Figure initially targeted.

The latest funding round comes after the robot maker secured $70 million last May, in a round led by Parkway Venture Capital."

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A gauge of global equity markets lost steam on Friday but still set a new high amid optimism over Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s potent results, while Treasury yields fell as the market bet that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates until at least June.

Wall Street mostly extended gains as Nvidia briefly shot above $2 trillion in market value for the first time, driven by the AI frenzy that has gripped investors since the chipmaker's blockbuster quarterly earnings report two days earlier.

Nvidia's shares jumped 4.9% to a high of $823.94, before paring gains to close up 0.4%. Investors worry valuations may be stretched after a rally that has lifted the more than 7% so far this year, but are optimistic about the profits companies may gain from artificial intelligence.

""We don't see that much more upside from current levels,"" said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management in New York.

""But we have to acknowledge that over the last year we have been consistently positively surprised by the enormous profit growth for some of the AI-leveraged companies,"" Marcelli told Reuters, adding that better-than-expected inflation could prompt the Fed to cut more than expected.

Data that showed U.S. services sector growth picked up in January as new orders increased and employment rebounded to help equity markets advance, though a measure of input prices rising to an 11-month high added fodder to fears of sticky inflation.

MSCI's all-country world index, a gauge of stock performance worldwide, closed up 0.1% after earlier hitting to a new intraday high.

The combination of strong growth and inflation not yet slowing to the Fed's 2% target has led Fed officials to push back on rate cut expectations.

The strength of the labor market has unequivocally emboldened the Fed to be more relaxed about keeping rates high for longer,"" said Dec Mullarkey, a managing director at SLC Management in Boston.

""So, the Fed is signaling it will be patient and use that runway to let more data roll in and cement the evidence that the economy is well balanced before they adjust rates,"" Mullarkey said.

Fed funds futures show a 52.6% chance of a cut in June, with a 35.5% probability of no cut, a sharp reversal from bets on Feb. 1 of a 62% chance of a cut in March, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ: ) FedWatch Tool.

The pan-European index rose 0.43% to post its fifth straight week of gains and a new closing high. The French and German indices also closed at record highs.

On Wall Street, the rose 0.16% and the S&P 500 eked out a 0.03% gain as both posted new closing highs. The dropped 0.28% but all three indices rose for the week, with the Dow up 1.3%, S&P 500 1.7% and the Nasdaq 1.4%.

The dollar was poised to record a weekly fall for the first time in 2024 as investors consolidated positions and sought further guidance on global economies. The rose 0.029%, with the euro down 0.03% to $1.082. On the data front in Europe, German business morale fell unexpectedly in Europe's biggest economy in December, an Ifo institute survey showed.

German bond yields were on track for their third straight weekly increase as the economic data and central bank officials continued to chip away at investors' hopes for rapid rate cuts by the European Central Bank this year.

Japan's stock market was closed for a public holiday on Friday, but futures rose nearly 1%, suggesting Japanese stocks will extend their record run next week.

Chinese shares wobbled between gains and losses. The index rose above the psychologically key 3,000-point mark. It is up 4.6% for the week and has bounced about 10% from five-year lows set more than two weeks ago.

Hong Kong's slipped 0.1%.

Data showed on Friday that China's new home prices fell for the seventh month in January, leaving sentiment fragile as policymakers' efforts to restore confidence in the debt-ridden sector struggled for traction.

A Reuters poll showed that the recent rally in global stocks had a little further to go but they were divided on whether there would be a correction in the next three months.

The two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, fell 2.2 basis points to 4.692%, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year note was down 7.5 basis points at 4.252%.

The 10-year hit a three-month high of 4.3540% overnight.

futures settled down $2.12 to $76.49 a barrel and fell $2.05 to settle at $81.62.

Gold prices were set for a weekly gain, buoyed by a softer dollar. U.S. settled 0.9% higher at $2,049.40 an ounce."

(Reuters) - The and eked out another closing record high on Friday, with all three Wall Street benchmarks scoring weekly gains, as artificial intelligence stocks had enough steam to keep the rally chugging along.

AI poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) advanced again, rising 0.4%, and briefly traded above $2 trillion in market valuation for the first time.

Nvidia's gains on Thursday, the session after its blowout earnings, had propelled the chipmaker to add $277 billion in stock market value, Wall Street's largest ever daily gain. Despite a smaller advance on the final trading day of the week, its performance still dominated the market's attention.

""Nvidia is one of the key companies, if not the key company, for driving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.

Saglimbene noted investors have been walking back expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which otherwise could be a headwind for markets. But the performance of Nvidia and other Big Tech has pushed Fed worries into the background.

""The concentration is so intense right now on Big Tech, in particular on Nvidia, that it's looking passed that,"" he said.

Nvidia had pulled up other Big Tech and growth stocks in previous sessions, as investors traded the AI play. Some of these names gave up some gains on Friday, as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) all fell between 0.4% and 2.8%.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), another beneficiary of the AI rally, dropped 11.8% after the server component maker priced its convertible notes.

The S&P 500 gained 1.77 points, or 0.03%, to end at 5,088.8 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 44.80 points, or 0.28%, to 15,996.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.42 points, or 0.16%, to 39,131.53.

A majority of the S&P sectors ended in positive territory. Among the best performers were utilities, as well as materials and industrials. All three climbed between 0.5% and 0.7%.

For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, the Dow rose 1.3% and the Nasdaq finished 1.4% higher.

Carvana surged 32.1% on Friday after reporting its first-ever annual profit, helped by its pact with bondholders to cut its outstanding debt by $1 billion.

Among Friday's decliners, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) shed 9.9% on reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as the media conglomerate battled the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.

Jack Dorsey-led Block jumped 16.1% after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.64 billion shares, compared with the 11.6 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

(Reuters) -Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday, riding on insatiable demand for its chips that made the Silicon Valley firm the pioneer of the generative artificial intelligence boom.

The milestone followed another bumper revenue forecast from the chip designer that drove up its market value by $277 billion on Thursday - Wall Street's largest one-day gain on record.

Its rapid ascent in the past year has led analysts to draw parallels to the picks and shovels providers during the gold rush of 1800s as Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s chips are used by almost all generative AI players from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI to Google (NASDAQ: ).

That has helped the company vault from $1 trillion to $2 trillion market value in around eight months - the fastest among U.S. companies and in less than half the time it took tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

""For AI companies today - the leaders of the sector - what's going to be binding for them is not going to be demand. It's just going to be their capacity to answer the surging demand,"" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

Nvidia's shares closed 0.4% higher on Friday, giving it a market value of about $1.97 trillion. They had risen as much as 4.9% to a record high of $823.94 earlier in the session, after a more than 16% jump on Thursday.

The shares have surged nearly 60% this year, after more than tripling in value in 2023. The chip designer's 2024 share surge has been crucial to the 's gains, contributing to more than a quarter of the stock index's rise this year.

Its latest market-beating forecast of whopping 233% growth in first-quarter revenue helped global markets notch record highs on Thursday.

The breakneck growth has drawn analysts and investors from far and wide to Nvidia.

""I'm a European fund manager, but I must have had more emails about their results than I've had about any other set. There have been calls, every broker doing 10-minute debriefs, it's been mind boggling,"" said one investor, who declined to be named.

Despite the share surge, Nvidia's valuation has fallen due to rapid increases in analysts' estimates. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 31, down from 49 times a year ago, according to LSEG data.

""Leading cloud computing companies plan to boost their capital expenditure to satisfy demand for AI training and inference, and it appears that virtually all this spending will fall into Nvidia's pockets,"" said Brian Colello, a strategist at Morningstar.

""We anticipate revenue will rise by a couple of billion each quarter throughout fiscal 2025 for Nvidia as more chip supply comes online."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Thursday said leading artificial intelligence companies are among more than 200 entities joining a new U.S. consortium to support the safe development and deployment of generative AI.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced the U.S. AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC), which includes OpenAI, Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google, Anthropic and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) along with Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Palantir (NYSE: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) and Bank of America.

""The U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence,"" Raimondo said in a statement.

The consortium, which also includes BP (NYSE: ), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: ), IBM (NYSE: ), Hewlett Packard, Northop Grumman, Mastercard (NYSE: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Visa (NYSE: ) and major academic institutions and government agencies, will be housed under the U.S. AI Safety Institute (USAISI).

The group is tasked with working on priority actions outlined in President Biden’s October AI executive order ""including developing guidelines for red-teaming, capability evaluations, risk management, safety and security, and watermarking synthetic content.""

Major AI companies last year pledged to watermark AI-generated content to make the technology safer. Red-teaming has been used for years in cybersecurity to identify new risks, with the term referring to U.S. Cold War simulations where the enemy was termed the ""red team.""

Biden's order directed agencies to set standards for that testing and to address related chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and cybersecurity risks.

In December, the Commerce Department said it was taking the first step toward writing key standards and guidance for the safe deployment and testing of AI.

The consortium represents the largest collection of test and evaluation teams and will focus on creating foundations for a ""new measurement science in AI safety,"" Commerce said.

Generative AI - which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts - has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower humans and catastrophic effects.

While the Biden administration is pursuing safeguards, efforts in Congress to pass legislation addressing AI have stalled despite numerous high-level forums and legislative proposals."

PLTR -2.61% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Palantir Technologies Inc . (NYSE: ), a leading provider of AI systems to the energy sector, and Bapco Upstream, a 100% owned subsidiary of Bapco Energies, today announced a strategic, multi-year partnership to deploy Palantir’s software to support and help accelerate Bapco Upstream’s ability to power the next generation of energy in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

Palantir’s Foundry Platform and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) will be deployed in a three-year agreement to help Bapco Upstream maximize its return on investment on energy production in the country and support its mission to connect the energy infrastructure of the Kingdom of Bahrain in an unprecedented way. Using data and artificial intelligence is a key part of the Kingdom of Bahrain's strategy to deliver on its commitment to reducing carbon emissions, as pledged at COP26 by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, to reduce emissions by 30 percent through decarbonization and efficiency initiatives by 2035, and double the Kingdom’s deployment of renewables, to achieve Net-Zero by 2060.

Airbnb cut to Neutral following the Q4 beat

DA Davidson downgraded Airbnb (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $145.00.

The company reported Tuesday better-than-expected Q4 results as strong demand for travel continued to drive bookings.

However, DA Davidson noted that management's forecast for the Q1 and the full year 2024 suggests a shift towards more normalized growth in room nights. There's also an expectation of slight year-over-year EBITDA margin compression due to investments in long-term growth initiatives, including efforts to deepen market penetration internationally, enhance marketing strategies, and expand AI and platform capabilities.

Shares are currently down around 4% in pre-market.

Quidel hit with 4 downgrades after a Q4 miss

After Quidel (NASDAQ: ) reported disappointing Q4 results, leading to a nearly 40% drop in its share price pre-market today, multiple Wall Street firms downgraded the stock.

William Blair adjusted its rating for Quidel to Market Perform from Outperform. The analysts pointed out that both the Q4 results and the 2024 outlook significantly fell short of adjusted EBITDA and EPS expectations. The primary reason for the shortfall in the guidance was lower than anticipated respiratory revenue, with the company adopting a cautious stance on forecasting these high-margin sales at the start of the year, “something that is likely better for long-term confidence in modeling, but a tough pill to take in the short term”.

JPMorgan shifted its rating to Underweight from Neutral, setting a new price target at $37, down from $66. Raymond James moved its rating to Outperform from Strong Buy, adjusting the price target to $76 from the previous $100. Meanwhile, Craig-Hallum downgraded the company to Hold from Buy.

Biogen downgraded following Q4 miss

Wells Fargo downgraded Biogen (NASDAQ: ) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $240.00 (from $315.00), following the company’s reported Q4 earnings miss, which resulted in a share price drop of more than 7% yesterday.

Our prior bull thesis was based on Skyclarys growth being the key story of 2024-25. However, the company missed 4Q sales at $56M vs. $64M consensus. More importantly the comments from the call suggested that the company is now in the ""finding the patients"" mode as the bolus has been treated. Penetration is already >20%, and we see less room for upside surprise in the near term. EU approval is positive, but sales inflection could take time.""

Palantir Technologies cut to Hold at HSBC

HSBC downgraded Palantir Technologies (NYSE: ) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $22.00 on full valuation.

The bank acknowledged Palantir's guidance for 2024, highlighting its emphasis on operating efficiency and revenue growth, which propelled the firm's impressive financial results for 2023. HSBC views Palantir as well-positioned to capitalize on robust demand for its artificial intelligence products, particularly in its rapidly expanding Commercial segment. Additionally, the Government segment is expected to see growth re-acceleration, driven by the execution of government contracts in 2024 and increased defense spending.

The bank projects Palantir's revenue will grow at a CAGR of 20.2% from 2023 to 2028, with its anti-terror and defense offerings benefiting from the conflicts and chaos currently plaguing the world.

Investing.com -- Main U.S. indexes rose strongly Thursday after blockbuster results from AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) helped boost sentiment, ahead of the release of more corporate earnings and important economic data.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) all have posted hefty gains, benefiting from Nvidia's strong outlook.

Moderna (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 9.5% after the drugmaker reported a surprise fourth-quarter profit, helped by cost cutting and some deferred payments.

Etsy (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 7% after the e-commerce company warned of a fall in first-quarter gross merchandise sales on weak demand for handcrafted goods and personalized gifts sold at its online marketplace.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped over 27% after the electric truck maker reported annual production guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates and announced deep job cuts.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose 1% after the carrier said it has reached a tentative agreement with Transport Workers Union that represents nearly 18,000 ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo agents.

Royal Caribbean (NYSE: ) stock rose 8% after the cruise operator raised its full-year income forecast, saying it has been encouraged by both the ""demand and pricing environment"" in 2024.

Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ) stock fell 3.7% after the liquefied company posted a 38.5% fall in its full-year LNG revenue, hurt by a fall in natgas prices.

Fiverr International (NYSE: ) stock fell 9% after the online freelance marketplace missed expectations with its fourth-quarter results, while the next quarter's revenue guidance of $92.5 million also underwhelmed.

Wayfair (NYSE: ) stock rose 7% after the online furniture retailer reported a narrower-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and said it returned to positive active customer growth.

On Wednesday, HSBC revised its stance on Palantir Technologies Inc . (NYSE: ), downgrading the stock from Buy to Hold while setting a price target of $22.00. The adjustment follows Palantir's recent guidance for 2024, which suggests a strategic emphasis on operating efficiency and revenue growth. This focus has been a significant factor behind the company's robust financial performance in 2023.

The firm acknowledges Palantir's advantageous position to leverage the robust demand for its artificial intelligence products. This is particularly true within the Commercial segment, which is experiencing rapid growth. Additionally, expectations are set for the Government segment to see renewed momentum due to the potential fulfillment of government contracts in the upcoming year and an uptick in defense spending.

Palantir's commercial operations in the United States have seen notable acceleration, driven by a strong market demand for the company's AI Platform. The firm's innovative marketing approach, which includes the introduction of short-term AI Platform (AIP) bootcamps, has been effective in securing new client acquisitions.

HSBC forecasts Palantir's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.2% from 2023 through 2028. This growth is anticipated as the company's anti-terrorism and defense products gain traction amidst global conflicts. Furthermore, the projection includes an improvement in non-GAAP operating margins by 14.15 percentage points, reaching 42.6% over the same period. Consequently, the non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.2%.

On Wednesday, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating and $405.00 price target for Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ), following the company's recent earnings report and strategic announcements. The firm's stance remains unchanged despite the market's post-earnings reaction, which was expected given the various factors at play.

According to Evercore ISI, their research indicates that Palo Alto Networks is not facing a demand issue, fundamental shifts, or new competitive threats. Management's decision to prioritize long-term growth over short-term revenue is seen as credible, and the firm believes this strategic choice will position the company for future expansion.

The strategy shift mentioned by management involves offering products free of charge to customers for an average of six months or until their existing contracts with competitors end. This move is part of a broader platformization strategy aimed at consolidating the market and accelerating adoption rates. Although this approach is expected to impact growth over the next four to six quarters, growth is anticipated to pick up again in the second half of fiscal year 2025, reaching mid-teens levels or higher in fiscal year 2026.

Evercore ISI highlighted that revenue and billings are projected to exceed pre-strategy levels by fiscal year 2026, thanks to the potential upside from more customers using more products. An example of this strategy's effectiveness is the acquisition of Talen, after which Palo Alto Networks offered its enterprise browser to all SASE customers free for a year, eliminating a key competitor.

While most key performance indicators (KPIs) for the quarter were positive, concerns remain regarding the impact on fiscal year 2024 billings. Approximately half of the anticipated weakness is attributed to the federal market, with the remainder linked to the strategic shift. Additionally, the delay and fragmentation of the prior $1.6 billion Thunderdome contract have led management to discount any significant contributions from the second half of the year that were previously expected.

InvestingPro Insights

In light of Evercore ISI's optimistic outlook on Palo Alto Networks, it's worth noting some key metrics and insights from InvestingPro that could be relevant for investors considering the company's future growth potential. Palo Alto Networks has been identified as a prominent player in the Software industry, with an expected net income growth this year, according to InvestingPro Tips. This aligns with management's strategy to prioritize long-term growth, which Evercore ISI views positively.

From a valuation perspective, Palo Alto Networks is currently trading at a high Price / Book multiple of 53.18, as of the last twelve months ending Q1 2024. This could suggest a premium market valuation, which investors often associate with companies that have strong future growth prospects. Additionally, the company has shown a remarkable Revenue Growth of 23.89% over the last twelve months, which may reflect the effectiveness of its strategic initiatives and the potential for future expansion.

Investors should also consider the company's performance in the market. Palo Alto Networks has experienced a strong return over the last three months, with a 38.65% price total return, and a significant 119.36% return over the last year, highlighting the positive investor sentiment and market recognition of its growth trajectory.

PANW +5.33% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Wednesday, Loop Capital adjusted its stance on Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ), downgrading the stock from Buy to Hold, despite increasing the price target to $300 from $280. The company, known for its cybersecurity solutions, has recently introduced a significant shift in its sales approach, which involves a robust up-front discount program. This program offers credits to customers who replace a competitor's product with a PANW one, essentially allowing for a period of free usage.

The analyst from Loop Capital expressed concerns that this aggressive sales tactic, while not unprecedented in the industry, is expected to be implemented on a large scale. This could lead to a negative impact on Palo Alto Networks' billings and revenue growth over the next 12 to 18 months. The move is anticipated to prompt competitors to adopt similar strategies, potentially diminishing the intended benefits for PANW.

The company's transition to this new go-to-market program is likely to introduce a high degree of variability and uncertainty. Investors may find it challenging to discern whether the slowdown in revenue and billings growth is attributable to the new strategy or a general decrease in demand. Management has suggested Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) as a metric to monitor progress during this transitional period. However, factors such as the timing of the renewal cycle and changes in contract duration could significantly influence RPO.

Loop Capital also noted that Palo Alto Networks' three-year growth targets, established six months prior, are now considered largely irrelevant. This shift has affected investor sentiment, which had previously been positive. In light of these developments, Loop Capital recommends a cautious approach, advising investors to remain on the sidelines during the initial stages of the new sales program's implementation. After the market closed, shares of Palo Alto Networks traded below the $300 price target, a figure that Loop Capital believes reflects both the long-term prospects and the immediate risks associated with the company's strategy shift.

On Wednesday, Rosenblatt Securities adjusted its stance on shares of Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ), downgrading the cybersecurity firm from Buy to Neutral and reducing the price target to $265 from $290. The firm's analysis followed Palo Alto Networks' announcement of a strategic shift, which sent its stock price tumbling by 20% in after-hours trading.

The company's management disclosed a mid-quarter strategic adjustment that has led to projections of lower billings and revenue than previously expected. This shift is attributed to customer spending fatigue and a heightened focus on solutions that offer a clear return on investment. In response to these market conditions, Palo Alto Networks is redirecting its efforts towards platformization, consolidation, and artificial intelligence leadership.

The strategy aims to position the company for long-term growth, with an objective to reach a $15B annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the year 2030. This pivot reflects Palo Alto Networks' commitment to evolving its business model to meet changing customer demands and market dynamics.

The downgrade and price target adjustment by Rosenblatt Securities indicate a more conservative outlook on Palo Alto Networks' near-term performance, as the company navigates through its strategic transition. The revised target of $265 represents a recalibration of expectations in light of the recent developments and the company's future plans.

CrowdStrike (CRWD) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why

CRWD +0.19% Add to/Remove from Watchlist NVDA +0.36% Add to/Remove from Watchlist PANW +5.33% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

What Happened: Shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: ) jumped 5.8% in the morning session as chip and AI stocks surged alongside broader market gains, with the Nasdaq rising by 2.1%, the S&P 500 by 1.5%, and the Dow gaining 0.57% following Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s outstanding earnings results. During its Q4'2024 earnings, Nvidia reported impressive topline results (7.6% revenue beat), big gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially during the quarter. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. The company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.

Guidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations.

Overall, Nvidia's strong performance during the quarter highlighted the growing demand for AI-related technology and demonstrated the abundant growth opportunity for innovators within the space.

Is now the time to buy CrowdStrike? Find out by reading the original article on StockStory.

What is the market telling us: CrowdStrike's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 15 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was one day ago, when the company dropped 11.8% after cybersecurity stocks fell as industry stalwart, Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ) reported fourth-quarter results and lowered full-year guidance for revenue and billings, with both metrics also falling below Wall Street's expectations. This is never a good sign. Furthermore, billings and revenue guidance for next quarter also missed Wall Street's estimates, with EPS below as well. Palo Alto Networks highlighted many challenges during the quarter, including 1.) weakness in the U.S. federal vertical, which impacted billings and revenue growth, and 2) Customers' conservativeness regarding upfront cash payments.

The long-term demand forecast provided was also concerning as management highlighted the possibility of ""a period of 12 to 18 months of pressure on our top-line growth rates, notably billings."" In addition, the top-line growth metrics are expected to be impacted by the company's shift towards a ""platformization"" strategy, which will make it easier for customers to consolidate their usage of cybersecurity solutions and provide the possibility of accessing some products for free in the early adoption phase. Under this strategy, Palo Alto Networks noted that a typical customer adopting the platform "" will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months."" This strategy may drive more competition within the cybersecurity space as industry players adjust their pricing/product strategies to stay competitive.

Overall, this was a weaker quarter for Palo Alto Networks, with the poor guidance highlighting several issues within the business as well as potential challenges for cybersecurity players in the coming quarter.

CrowdStrike is up 25.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $308.88 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $334.55 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of CrowdStrike's shares at the IPO in June 2019 would now be looking at an investment worth $5,325."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The and Dow Jones industrials eked out small gains on Wednesday, while the Nasdaq closed lower for a third straight session as investors awaited the release of Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s earnings that could determine near-term momentum for equities.

After the closing bell, Nvidia shares surged 6% after it forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates on robust demand for its chips that dominate the market for artificial intelligence (AI).

During the session, Nvidia shares fell 2.85%, adding to the previous day's decline of more than 4% for the chip designer.

Nvidia shares have soared nearly 40% this year, making it the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after a leap of almost 240% in 2023. Analysts had cautioned that its lofty valuation could make the stock vulnerable to a sharp pullback if the company delivered anything short of a blowout report.

""It's been driven by excitement and enthusiasm around AI and of course the AI darling in the room is Nvidia,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah.

""Markets are looking at Nvidia with a little bit of anxiety, maybe ... we need to see a good report from the leader in the space and that leader is Nvidia.""

The S&P 500 climbed 0.13% to end the session at 4,981.80 points. The Nasdaq declined 0.32% to 15,580.87 points, while the rose 0.13% to 38,612.24 points.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed most policymakers were concerned about risks of cutting interest rates too soon, with broad uncertainty about how long borrowing costs should remain at their current level.

After the release of the minutes, traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures stuck to bets the Fed will begin cutting interest rates no earlier than June.

Despite the modest advance, nearly all of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with only the heavily weighted technology index lower with a decline of 0.76%. Energy shares led gainers with a rise of 1.86%.

Wall Street's 2024 rally ran into turbulence last week after data hinted at sticky inflation, raising concerns the Fed would be in no hurry to cut interest rates.

The January inflation data complicates upcoming rate decisions, Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkin said.

Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ) plunged 28.44% after the cybersecurity firm forecast third-quarter billings below analyst estimates.

Shares of other cybersecurity companies such as Fortinet (NASDAQ: ), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ) and Crowdstrike Holdings were also weaker.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) edged up, with the company set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average effective next week, replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance (O: ), which saw its shares decline.

Advancing issues were roughly even with decliners by on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.73-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 25 new highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 96 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 10.5 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions."

In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital payments, PayPal (NASDAQ: ) Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) stands as a significant player, renowned for its technology platform that facilitates mobile and online payments across the globe. With over 400 million users, PayPal's reach spans consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets, positioning it at the forefront of the industry. However, the company's journey is marked by both opportunities and challenges as it navigates through strategic shifts and competitive pressures.

Company Overview

PayPal's service suite is expansive, including the traditional branded payment solutions and the Braintree payment gateway, which caters to large enterprise e-commerce processing. The company has recently undergone a leadership transformation, with CEO Alex Chriss at the helm, steering towards a more efficient and cohesive platform-centric business model. This strategic pivot aims to leverage PayPal's substantial data assets, optimize the checkout process, and expand the adoption of PayPal Complete Payments among small businesses both in the U.S. and globally.

Market Performance and Trends

Analysts have noted that PayPal's branded volumes have been growing, albeit at a rate that trails behind market expectations. In contrast, the unbranded volumes, primarily from Braintree, have seen impressive growth rates, signaling a diversification of revenue sources and an expanding market reach. This shift in volume mix is pivotal as it impacts transaction margins and take rates, with unbranded volumes typically associated with lower margins compared to the higher-margin branded business.

The company's stock has experienced volatility, reflecting investor sentiment around its strategic direction, execution capabilities, and market trends. While the stock price has seen fluctuations, it remains a closely watched asset on Wall Street, with analysts providing varied price targets and ratings based on their projections and the company's performance indicators.

Strategic Initiatives and Financial Outlook

Under new leadership, PayPal has embarked on several initiatives aimed at driving growth and improving profitability. These include enhancing the user experience, focusing on small and medium-sized business development, and streamlining operations to eliminate redundancies. The company is also prioritizing the rollout of its SMB commerce platform and exploring ""price to value"" strategies in Braintree to drive margin expansion.

Financially, PayPal has reported solid total payment volume growth and better-than-expected core earnings per share in recent quarters. However, there is a consensus among analysts that transaction margin growth has been under pressure, prompting the company to recalibrate its financial outlook and adjust growth estimates.

Bear Case

Can PayPal navigate margin pressures effectively?

With the growth of lower-margin Braintree volumes outpacing the traditional branded business, there is concern over the sustainability of PayPal's profitability. The shift towards unbranded transactions, while indicative of market expansion, poses a threat to operating margins. Despite cost-saving initiatives that could bolster earnings per share, the focus on transaction margin dollar growth remains a critical area for the company's financial health.

Will the strategic shift under new leadership pay off?

The recent change in CEO and the ongoing strategy formulation have introduced a degree of uncertainty regarding PayPal's medium-term financial expectations. While the new CEO's emphasis on profitable growth and efficient operations is welcomed, the immediate future may not reflect significant changes as the company adjusts under new management. Investors are watching closely to see if the strategic pivot will yield the anticipated improvements in execution and profitability.

Bull Case

Can new leadership unlock PayPal's untapped potential?

The arrival of CEO Alex Chriss has been met with optimism, as his vision for PayPal includes a focus on cost management, value-added service pricing, and improved financial transparency. Analysts see potential for the company to stabilize key metrics and execute a turnaround, leveraging its strong brand recognition and strategic value.

Is PayPal's growth trajectory poised for acceleration?

Despite lowered guidance for the near term, PayPal is expected to benefit from its high exposure to digital commerce, which should support premium growth relative to other scale processors. The company's strategic initiatives under the new CEO are anticipated to simplify the business and focus on accelerating gross profit growth on a leaner cost base in the coming year.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

- Strong brand recognition and global user base.

- Diversified revenue streams with both branded and unbranded payment solutions.

- Strategic initiatives aimed at improving user experience and operational efficiency.

Weaknesses:

- Pressure on transaction margins due to the growth of lower-margin unbranded volumes.

- Transition phase under new leadership introducing short-term uncertainty.

- Exposure to competitive pressures in the digital payments market.

Opportunities:

- Expansion of SMB commerce platform to drive market share and revenue growth.

- Leveraging data assets to optimize checkout processes and enhance user engagement.

- Potential for margin expansion through cost-saving initiatives and value-added services.

Threats:

- Regulatory scrutiny and potential conflicts of interest in using customer purchase data.

- Macroeconomic headwinds that could impact consumer spending and e-commerce growth.

- Intense competition from other payment platforms and financial technology companies.

Analysts Targets

- Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Overweight, Price Target $118.00 (November 02, 2023).

- J.P. Morgan Securities LLC: Overweight, Price Target $80.00 (November 02, 2023).

PayPal's management has acknowledged that while they are prioritizing profitable growth, the increasing mix of unbranded transactions is impacting transaction margins. Consequently, transaction margin dollars are anticipated to remain flat year-over-year as the company enters the fiscal year 2024.

The firm's analysis suggests that PayPal's muted outlook indicates significant challenges ahead. The tone of the management's commentary was interpreted as highlighting structural issues within the company rather than temporary market cycles. This implies that PayPal will have to engage in substantial work to overcome these hurdles.

Despite the lowered price target, the outperform rating suggests that Macquarie continues to see potential in PayPal's stock. The firm's commentary indicates a belief in the company's strategic initiatives and their eventual positive impact on PayPal's financial performance.

Investors and market watchers will be keeping a close eye on PayPal's progress as it implements its strategy in the competitive digital payments landscape. The company's efforts to enhance its branded checkout and PSP services, along with improving operating efficiency and consumer experiences, are critical to its success in the fiscal year 2024 and beyond.

InvestingPro Insights

As PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) strives to navigate through its strategic initiatives, the latest data from InvestingPro provides a clearer picture of the company's financial health and market position. With a market capitalization of $64.4 billion, PayPal is recognized as a prominent player in the Financial Services industry, which aligns with its efforts to improve branded checkout and PSP capabilities.

The company's current P/E ratio stands at 15.58, which suggests that it is trading at a low price relative to near-term earnings growth—a point that may interest investors looking for value opportunities. This is reinforced by the fact that PayPal is profitable over the last twelve months as of Q1 2023, with a revenue growth of 8.19% and a gross profit margin of 39.59%, indicating a solid financial performance.

One of the InvestingPro Tips highlights that management has been aggressively buying back shares, which can be a signal of the company's confidence in its future prospects. Additionally, the tip that analysts predict the company will be profitable this year provides further optimism for potential investors. However, it is worth noting that 21 analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, which suggests that there may be some caution in the short-term outlook.

Tuesday, Daiwa Securities adjusted its stance on PayPal Holdings Inc . (NASDAQ: ), shifting the rating from Outperform to Neutral and modifying the price target to $62 from the previous $64. The revision reflects a new valuation based on updated earnings per share (EPS) estimates, factoring in stock-based compensation expense from the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024.

The analyst cited PayPal's conservative guidance for the fiscal year 2024 as a reason for the reduced consensus estimate. Despite acknowledging that the shares appear undervalued when considering valuation metrics the firm sees challenges in predicting the medium to long-term growth in EPS. The firm believes it will be difficult to identify a clear growth path for transaction margin dollars and to see the benefits of increased investments until they begin to materially impact earnings.

Daiwa Securities pointed out that 2024 is expected to be a pivotal year for PayPal, focusing on executing its strategic plan. However, the firm anticipates that it will take time for service improvements to translate into earnings growth, making it tough to gauge the potential for EPS growth in the medium term. As a result, the investment rating has been lowered to Neutral.

The firm is looking for clear signs of growth and the successful implementation of PayPal's investments before reconsidering its investment rating. The analyst emphasized that once there is a return to a clear growth trajectory for transaction margin dollars and the benefits from ramped-up investments are evident, PayPal could potentially see strong profit growth. Daiwa Securities intends to monitor the company's performance closely, awaiting the right moment to possibly revise its investment opinion.

PayPal receives one more downgrade

PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: ) shares fell more than 1% pre-market today after Daiwa Securities downgraded the company to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $62.00 (from $64.00), as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.

This represents the third downgrade since last Wednesday when the company reported its quarterly results. While it posted better-than-expected Q4 EPS and revenues, its shares fell sharply on Thursday due to a flat profit forecast.

Unity Software cut to Underperform

Macquarie downgraded Unity Software (NYSE: ) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $20.00, noting that the company's efforts to reduce staff costs are insufficient to address the underlying issues within the company.

Macquarie's downgrade stems from three main concerns. Firstly, they are worried about the scope of reorganization the company is currently undertaking, which includes key ironSource departures. This is because ""the ad tech merger has underperformed”. Secondly, they ""expect a delay in game engine monetization until 2025 due to likely lower Unity seat licenses as game developers have laid off staff as well."" Macquarie also sees delayed revenue upside from price increases and runtime fees until after Unity 6 launches.

Two more downgrades



Rosenblatt downgraded Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy, while raising its price target to $280.00 from $265.00.

The analysts noted that Cadence's Q4/23 results, announced Monday after market close, aligned closely with revenue projections and exhibited slightly improved margins. Although Cadence's initial fiscal 2024 guidance matched the analyst's growth expectation of 11.6%, the Q1/24 revenue forecast was about 10% lower than anticipated. This shortfall is partly attributed to a modest 3% year-over-year increase in the Backlog, reaching $6 billion in Q4. The Q1 revenue projection of $990 million to $1,010 million (with a midpoint of $1,000 million) fell significantly short of the consensus estimate of $1,090.3M.

Given current price levels, we are downgrading our rating to Neutral from Buy and expect the stock to react negatively in the near term to the lower Q1 outlook and the weaker expected contribution from China in 2024.

Shares are currently down 7% in pre-market.

BofA Securities downgraded Duckhorn Portfolio (NYSE: ) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $8.00 (from $11.00). As a result, shares dropped more than 4% pre-market today.

PYPL +1.39% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) was cut to Neutral from Outperform at Daiwa on Tuesday, with the firm also lowering its price target for the stock to $62 from $64 per share.

Following the company's earnings release, the firm lowered its forecasts for non-GAAP EPS and is now calling for $5.16 for 2024, down from $5.61. For 2025, they see EPS at $5.56, and for 2026, they expect $6.18.

""With the company's guidance looking conservative, we see considerable potential for an overshoot, but at this stage, we are lacking the conviction to factor in sharp upside,"" said Daiwa analysts. ""As such, we intend to closely observe quarterly earnings performance to get a gauge of upside potential.""

Analysts feel it is difficult to envision medium/long-term EPS growth for the company until there is a return to a clear growth trajectory for transaction margin dollars and the benefits from ramped-up investments emerge.

Once those factors fall into place, the firm thinks strong profit growth will be possible for PYPL."

By Mike Scarcella

(Reuters) - Pfizer (NYSE: ) has agreed to pay $93 million to settle antitrust claims by wholesale drug distributors that accused it of conspiring with India's Ranbaxy Laboratories to delay sales of less expensive, generic versions of the cholesterol drug Lipitor.

Attorneys for Lipitor purchasers including Rochester Drug Co-Operative Inc and Puerto Rico's Drogueria Betances LLC disclosed the agreement in a filing on Wednesday in U.S. court in Trenton, New Jersey.

The distributors' case will continue against Ranbaxy, the attorneys filing said.

The proposed settlement, which requires a judge's approval, comes after more than a decade of litigation. Pfizer did not admit liability.

Pfizer in a statement called the allegations ""factually and legally without merit."" It said the settlement was ""fair, reasonable and the best way to resolve this litigation.""

A representative for Sun Pharma, which acquired Ranbaxy in 2014, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pfizer introduced Lipitor in 1997, and the drug drove more than $130 billion in sales during its first 14 years on the market.

The pharma distributors claimed Pfizer fraudulently sought to extend its patent rights over Lipitor. They accused the company of paying Ranbaxy to delay introducing a generic version of Lipitor and engaging in sham litigation with Ranbaxy over the drug.

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the settlement provides ""immediate economic relief"" to class members and avoids the risk of continued litigation, potential appeals and no recovery. They said they will seek up to about $31 million in legal fees from the settlement fund.

The case is In re: Lipitor Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 3:12-cv-02389-PGS-JBD."

PYXS +2.53% Add to/Remove from Watchlist PFE +0.73% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Friday, BTIG initiated coverage on Pyxis Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:PYXS) with a Buy rating and a price target of $8.00. The firm highlighted Pyxis's status as a pure-play antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) company with a proprietary technology platform that has evolved from over a decade of ADC innovation at Pfizer (NYSE: ). Pfizer holds approximately a 13% equity stake in Pyxis as of February 5, 2024.

The technology platform of Pyxis Oncology allows for the development of homogeneous ADCs, employing a variety of linkers, payloads, and conjugation chemistry. This approach is considered the forefront of ADC development, similar to the strategy that led to the recent acquisition of Ambrx by Johnson & Johnson. Pyxis's lead ADC, PYX-201, targets a non-internalizing protein found in tumor stroma, which could offer a differentiated safety profile.

PYX-201's mechanism, which relies on the acidic environment of tumors for linker cleavage and a bystander effect focused on the tumor region, shares similarities with Gilead (NASDAQ: )'s Trodelvy and most approved ADCs, including Enhertu's approval in the Her2-low setting. Additionally, the components of PYX-201 were validated by Pfizer's PF-06804103 in a Phase 1/2 trial before the era of Enhertu.

Pyxis plans to report initial data from its dose-escalation trial and outline subsequent dose-expansion studies by mid-2024. Positive results could significantly enhance the company's valuation. The firm also has an immuno-oncology pipeline, including an anti-Siglec-15 monoclonal antibody, PYX-106, with Phase 1 trial data expected in the second half of 2024.

BTIG believes that Pyxis's broad offering, which includes both organic and partnered pipelines, combined with its proprietary ADC technology and recently acquired Apximab antibody manufacturing technology, positions the company to improve its development and partnership potential. The current market price, roughly equal to Pyxis's cash position of about $3 per share, is seen as an attractive entry point ahead of these anticipated developments.

InvestingPro Insights

As Pyxis Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:PYXS) continues to attract attention with its cutting-edge ADC technology and promising pipeline, investors may find value in examining the company's financial health and market performance. Utilizing real-time data and insights from InvestingPro, here's a snapshot of Pyxis's current market position:

The company's Market Cap stands at $3,683.47 million, reflecting the market's valuation of Pyxis's potential in the biotechnology space.

Pyxis trades with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio of 16.34, which adjusts to a more attractive 11.73 when considering the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, indicating a favorable valuation relative to near-term earnings growth.

Despite a challenging environment, Pyxis has maintained a consistent dividend payment for 32 consecutive years, boasting a current Dividend Yield of 4.83%, which may appeal to income-focused investors.

InvestingPro Tips for Pyxis Oncology highlight that analysts are predicting the company will be profitable this year, a crucial factor for investors gauging the financial stability and growth potential of the firm. Additionally, the stock's low price volatility suggests it could be a more stable investment in the often turbulent biotech sector.

On Friday, Guggenheim initiated coverage on Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: NYSE: ) with a Buy rating, setting a price target of $36.00. The move comes after a period of significant underperformance for Pfizer shares, which have dropped more than 50% since mid-December 2021. This decline stands in contrast to the 's approximately 8% rise and the DRG index's roughly 25% increase in the same timeframe.

The analyst from Guggenheim noted that investor expectations for Pfizer's COVID-19 related assets, including the vaccine Comirnaty and the oral antiviral treatment Paxlovid, have now been adjusted to more realistic levels. Despite challenges facing several of Pfizer's major revenue streams, there is potential for near-term estimate increases. This optimism is based on the successful commercialization of upcoming opportunities, such as Padcev for first-line bladder cancer treatment and Abrysvo for RSV prophylactic vaccination.

Guggenheim's analysis also highlights that the low investor expectations currently set for Pfizer could lead to positive shifts in sentiment should the company achieve clinical success with its promising pipeline assets. These include treatments like vepdegestrant, VLA15, and ponsegromab. The firm suggests that these developments, coupled with Pfizer's current dividend yield of approximately 6%, provide a stable foundation for the stock as management continues to execute its strategic plans.

The analyst's comments underscore the potential for Pfizer to rebound from its recent underperformance.

By Michael Martina

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. should review Chinese biotech firm WuXi AppTec and its affiliate WuXi Biologics (HK: ) for sanctions, a bipartisan group of lawmakers told top Biden administration officials on Monday.

In a letter dated Feb. 12 and seen by Reuters, the lawmakers told Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo that the global pharmaceutical giant's links to China's Communist Party and military threatened U.S. national security.

The letter, signed by the Republican chair and Democratic ranking member of the House select committee on China, Representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Senators Gary Peters and Bill Hagerty, is Congress' latest effort to highlight what it says are risks posed by China's biotech leaders.

Congress has introduced legislation that would restrict federally-funded medical providers from allowing China's BGI Group, WuXi AppTec and other biotech firms from getting genetic information about Americans.

WuXi AppTec did not respond immediately to a request for comment, but has repeatedly said that it is not a national security risk to any country.

""We are concerned by a misguided U.S. legislative initiative to target our company without a fair and transparent review of the facts,"" WuXi AppTec said previously in a statement still on its website home page.

The four lawmakers – citing public Chinese government documents, Chinese university websites and media articles – outlined what they called WuXi AppTec's clear military ties, as well as support for China's policies in Xinjiang, a region where Washington has accused Beijing of committing genocide against Muslim minorities.

They said WuXi AppTec had received investment from numerous PLA funds, including the AVIC Military-Civil Integration Selected Hybrid Securities Investment Fund.

They also cited a resume for WuXi Biologics CEO Chen Zhisheng, posted in 2018 to a Tsinghua University website, that listed him as a visiting professor at China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences, which was added to the Commerce Department's export control list in 2021.

""Given WuXi AppTec's clear ties to the CCP and the PLA and its likely role in enabling the genocide in Xinjiang, we urge your departments to consider the inclusion of WuXi AppTec and its subsidiaries on your respective control lists,"" they said in the letter.

Those should include sanctions under Treasury's Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, the Commerce list restricting U.S. sales to named entities and the Pentagon's ""1260H"" list, which carries implicit warnings about U.S. cooperation with certain firms.

""WuXi AppTec and WuXi Biologics have obscured their ties to the CCP and PLA and, as a result, are rapidly integrating themselves into U.S. supply chains by signing agreements with prominent U.S. biotech entities,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The two companies have counted Pfizer (NYSE: ), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: ) , and U.S. national labs as partners."

PFE +0.73% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

A team of Guggenheim analysts started research coverage on Pfizer (NYSE: ) with a Buy rating and a 12-month target price of $36, implying roughly 30% upside from Thursday’s closing price.

PFE rose 0.5% in premarket trading.

Over the past two years, Pfizer's stock has notably lagged behind expectations, a period marked by heightened investor anticipation for the company's COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and its oral antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, amid the pandemic.

“We believe expectations for Pfizer's COVID assets have now appropriately come down and, while several of their other largest revenue generators are also facing challenges, we see an opportunity for near-term estimates to increase,” said analysts.

This opportunity depends on whether Pfizer can “successfully commercialize large potential opportunities, such as Padcev in 1L bladder cancer and Abrysvo for prophylactic vaccination against RSV,” they added.

Currently, with investor expectations for PFE being quite low, any clinical success from notable pipeline assets like vepdegestrant, VLA15, and ponsegromab could boost investor confidence and enhance long-term forecasts, the broker commented.

“Beyond the products that have already launched, we believe Pfizer now has an interesting mix of internally-developed and externally-acquired assets that can drive potential upside in 2027+, if successfully developed,” the analysts wrote.

Meanwhile, the existing dividend yield of approximately 6% offers stock support as management progresses with its strategy."

A comprehensive study involving nearly 100 million people vaccinated against COVID-19 has confirmed the association of the vaccines with certain side effects, such as myocarditis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, echoing earlier findings.

The analysis highlighted that the risk of these conditions is higher following coronavirus infection than from vaccination, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the benefits of immunization against its risks.

Conducted by the Global COVID Vaccine Safety project, the research encompassed data from 99,068,901 individuals in eight countries, focusing on adverse reactions after receiving Pfizer (NYSE: ), Moderna (NASDAQ: ), and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) vaccines.

The study sought to identify 13 specific adverse events within 42 days post-vaccination, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell’s palsy, convulsions, myocarditis, and pericarditis.

Recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine showed a marked increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome cases within 42 days of vaccination, the study found.

Moreover, an unexpected rise in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) cases, a condition causing inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, was observed after the first dose of Moderna’s vaccine.

However, the findings regarding ADEM showed “no consistent pattern in terms of vaccine or timing following vaccination, and larger epidemiological studies have not confirmed any potential association.”

The study also found a significant uptick in myocarditis cases, particularly following the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, consistently across the first, second, and third doses.

Further, instances of pericarditis were significantly higher than anticipated after the first and fourth doses of Moderna’s vaccine."

(Reuters) -Moderna on Thursday reported a surprise fourth-quarter profit, helped by cost cutting and deferred payments, and set out a commercial roadmap for its vaccines in Europe and experimental respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) shot.

Shares jumped 8% to $94.65 in early trading, still well off the record high of $497.49 hit during the peak of the COVID pandemic in 2021.

Waning demand for COVID vaccines and anticipation of a loss for 2023 led to a steep decline in Moderna (NASDAQ: )'s shares last year.

Moderna posted a profit of $217 million, or 55 cents a share, for the quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 97 cents a share, according to LSEG data.

Moderna Chief Financial Officer James Mock in an interview said the company beat its own forecast because of unexpected deferred revenue of $600 million from the international vaccine group Gavi.

The company also saved around $300 million from its effort last year to adjust its manufacturing output, he said.

""Our resizing was mostly completed at the end of the third quarter, but there is still plenty of work to do to drive additional productivity,"" he said.

Lee Brown, healthcare lead at global research firm Third Bridge, said Moderna's resizing and other cost-saving efforts would allow the company to invest in further growth.

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based drugmaker reported fourth quarter sales of $2.8 billion from its COVID vaccine, its only commercial product, down 43% from 2022 but in line with analysts' expectations.

Moderna on an investor call said it could not compete in the EU in the second half of last year because of a competitor contract, but was participating in the bloc's 2024 tender for up to 36 million doses of COVID vaccines per year for up to four years.

Mock said he was not sure how long the EU tender would take, but would ""imagine a decision in the coming months"" in time for the fall market.

The company has been banking on its experimental shots including for RSV, influenza and cancer to make up for declining COVID revenue.

Moderna expects a U.S. approval decision for its RSV vaccine by May 12. The company said it also planned to launch its RSV shot in Germany and Australia this year.

Jefferies analyst Michael Yee in a note said he expects ""a fairly smooth FDA approval.""

Analysts estimate the shot will generate $280 million in 2024.

Data posted earlier this month showed the vaccine was 63%effective at preventing RSV-related respiratory symptoms after 8.6 months, down from 84% at 3.3 months.

The results raised concerns among investors over faster efficacy declines compared with rival shots from GSK and Pfizer (NYSE: ), both of which launched last year.

The company said it expects to have further data on the vaccine's effectiveness in generating neutralizing antibodies by the end of the year.

Moderna also expects data from late-stage trials of its next generation COVID shot and its cytomegalovirus and COVID-flu combination vaccines this year.

In November, the company pushed back the launch of its flu shot from 2024 to the following year. It said it intends to file for approval this year.

The company reaffirmed its 2024 forecast of $4 billion in sales, the lowest figure for annual revenue since its COVID vaccine got U.S. emergency authorization in late 2020.

Analysts on average estimate the company will bring in $4.48 billion in 2024 revenue, down 33% from 2023.

""Last year was a year of transition that we had to do, and the volume was not quite what we had expected it to be,"" Mock said. ""We took actions to resize the company and we're excited to execute in 2024."""

RIVN -12.05% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Thursday, CFRA made a significant adjustment to its stance on Rivian (NASDAQ: ) Automotive Inc (NASDAQ: RIVN), downgrading the electric vehicle maker's stock from Hold to Sell. The firm also halved Rivian's price target, bringing it down to $10 from the previous estimate of $20.

The downgrade came after Rivian reported its fourth-quarter earnings, which showed an adjusted EPS of -$1.36, falling short of the -$1.32 consensus. This miss was attributed to higher-than-expected costs. Despite this, the company's revenue of $1.32 billion exceeded expectations by $60 million.

Rivian has also provided its full-year production and EBITDA guidance, aiming for 57,000 units and an EBITDA loss of -$2.7 billion, respectively. This guidance is slightly more optimistic than the current consensus of a -$2.6 billion EBITDA loss, and it indicates a marginal decrease from the 57,232 vehicles produced in 2023.

The company concluded the year 2023 with a cash and short-term investments balance of $9.4 billion, a decrease from $11.6 billion at the end of the previous year. CFRA's revised outlook reflects skepticism towards Rivian's ability to significantly reduce its EBITDA loss by approximately $1.4 billion this year, especially with projected lower vehicle production volumes.

CFRA's critical view of Rivian's financial future is based on the premise that the company's adjusted EBITDA guidance is overly optimistic. The analysis suggests that Rivian's hopes to cut its EBITDA loss from 2023's figures are not grounded in the reality of the current demand for its vehicles.

On Friday, Truist Securities revised its stance on Rivian (NASDAQ: ) Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN), downgrading the stock from a Buy to a Hold rating. The firm also significantly reduced its price target from $26.00 to $11.00. The adjustment comes as Truist Securities shifts its focus to Rivian's future, particularly in light of the upcoming first shipments of the R2 model slated for 2026.

The analyst acknowledged Rivian's strong execution and the potential value of its vertically-integrated business model and unique brand. However, concerns were raised regarding the immediate capital needs of the company, which are expected to limit stock growth as Rivian approaches an extended period of plant shutdowns. This is predicted to result in year-over-year volumes remaining flat.

Truist Securities indicated that for investor sentiment to turn positive on Rivian shares again, there would need to be tangible signs of gross margin improvement and robust initial orders for the R2 model. The expectation is that these factors would be necessary to reignite optimism in the stock.

The decision to downgrade Rivian and reduce the price target was also influenced by a reassessment of forecasts, considering the company's near-term challenges and the broader market outlook for Rivian as it prepares for its next major product launch.

By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) - A global slowdown in electric-vehicle demand is rippling through the industry, costing jobs and leading to changes in strategic plans, layoffs and production cuts, suggesting pain in the near term could slow the transition away from gasoline-powered combustion engines.

On Thursday, German luxury carmaker Mercedes toned down expectations on EV demand and said it will update its gasoline-powered engine vehicle lineup well into the next decade.

Mercedes delayed its goal to go all-electric by 2030. Instead, it now says it will retain combustion engines in at least half of its vehicles until then. Previously, it had hedged by saying consumer demand would dictate how soon it went all-electric.

""High interest rates, moderate oil prices, and range anxiety all have conspired against EV demand. The enthusiasm of early adopters of EVs wasn’t representative of the longer-term and broader demand for these vehicles,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, which does not own shares in any EV makers.

""We expected a reduction in demand and enthusiasm for the vehicles so we didn't find the valuations compelling,"" he added.

The pivot by Mercedes comes a day after EV startups Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) forecast 2024 production well below analysts' expectations and Rivian cut its workforce by 10%. That news caused shares of Rivian and Lucid to tumble on Thursday by 27.5% and 19.5%, respectively.

The pain follows last year's price war that drained margins and pressured many companies' already money-losing EV operations.

""There is a host of macro-level challenges,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that high interest rates and geopolitical risks were making consumers price-sensitive.

The situation was previously flagged by Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ) and market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ), where CEO Elon Musk's warning in January of the market leader's slowing pace of growth slashed $80 billion in market value in one day.

Prices for used EVs collapsed by 16.4% in January compared with a year ago, according to Manheim Used Vehicle Value index data. Even in China, the world's largest auto market where demand for EVs has been strong, new-energy vehicle sales fell 38% in January, the first monthly drop since August 2023.

That drumbeat of bad news even has the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden set to propose a softening of limits on tailpipe emissions designed to get more Americans into EVs, sources said.

Earlier this month, Volvo (OTC: ) Cars decided to halt investments in Polestar (NASDAQ: ) after the money-losing luxury EV offshoot brand missed a 2023 delivery target.

Some industry observers argue that the long-term picture of a transition to EVs remains in place despite any short-term road bumps.

""A slowdown in the growth rate from 45% to something more sustainable is not the disaster the press has been pushing. And interest rates affect all car sales, not just EVs,"" said Vitaly Golomb, a Rivian investor and investment banker who focuses on mobility.

""The effect is more pronounced on more expensive vehicles of course and EVs still average higher price,"" he added. ""Perhaps (automakers) need to emphasize the stark difference in total cost of ownership."""

RIVN -12.05% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Friday, UBS downgraded shares of Rivian (NASDAQ: ) Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:RIVN) from Buy to Sell and significantly reduced the price target to $8.00 from the previous $24.00. The investment firm adjusted its outlook due to a ""rapidly changing EV backdrop,"" which has led to a reassessment of demand for Rivian's products and brand. The revised strategy now appears more challenging for Rivian as it works towards profitability and positive cash flow.

The downgrade reflects concerns about softer demand for U.S. battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and specifically for Rivian's offerings. UBS forecasts that Rivian's total deliveries for the years 2025, 2026, and 2027 will be approximately 75,000, 89,000, and 148,000 units, respectively. These figures represent an average decrease of around 33% from previous estimates and are roughly 42% below the consensus.

In addition to the lowered delivery projections, UBS also sees risks to Rivian's gross profit and EBITDA guidance for 2024. The firm anticipates a delay in Rivian reaching EBITDA and free cash flow (FCF) breakeven points. This adjustment in financial expectations comes as the market for electric vehicles continues to evolve and become more competitive.

UBS has also raised concerns about potential capital raises that Rivian might need to undertake. According to the firm, these could represent a significant portion of Rivian's current market capitalization, potentially amounting to approximately 30%. This anticipated need for additional capital could further pressure the automaker's financial position as it strives to establish itself in the competitive EV market.

The revised price target and stock rating reflect a more cautious stance on Rivian's ability to navigate the challenges in the current market environment. Rivian's journey towards profitability and positive cash flow appears to be fraught with more obstacles than previously anticipated by UBS.

By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: ) tumbled on Thursday after their earnings reports pointed to the impact of slowing electric-vehicle demand on their costly ramp-up plans.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) tanked 25% to a record low after it forecast flat growth in annual production, also hurt by a shutdown of its assembly line for upgrades. Lucid sank 9% as its production forecast also came below estimates.

The companies said an uncertain economic outlook and high interest rates were hitting demand for EVs, echoing remarks from market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and legacy automakers like Ford (NYSE: ).

""Despite having built a highly rated and desirable EV, Rivian appears to have hit a near-term air-pocket and caught the recent EV bug,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas, who cut his price target on the stock by $10 to $20.

EV startups have been burning billions of dollars in cash in their efforts to develop, source and ramp up manufacturing of vehicles, hoping to be the next Tesla.

Rivian was set to lose more than $3.5 billion in market capitalization, if the losses hold, while Lucid's valuation was set to fall by nearly $1 billion.

Their stocks have had a weak start to the year, with Rivian down 34% and Lucid down 12%, after a tumultuous 2023 when Tesla's price war roiled the industry.

Rivian said on Wednesday it expected to post its first gross profit in the fourth quarter, after it reported a loss of about $43,000 per vehicle in the October-December period.

In comparison, Ford's Model E electric vehicle division lost an average of more than $47,000 per vehicle in the same period.

CHEAPER MODELS

Rivian is betting on the R2 sport utility vehicle set to be unveiled next month to compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover and attract customers with a smaller and cheaper EV.

But the R2 SUV, which is expected to be priced around $50,000, is set to be launched only in 2026.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said much of the upgrades to the R1 assembly line in the second quarter were made to enable the R2 vehicles.

Lucid, meanwhile, plans to start production of the Gravity SUV, with more than 400 miles of range and expected to be priced at $80,000 later this year, with larger volumes expected in 2025 onwards.

Lucid also discussed a third model in the midsize category, slated for production in late 2026, but did not provide further details on the model.

""We view near-term deliveries as an unknown, with that uncertainty spreading to Lucid's Gravity SUV launch, with Lucid's midsize program set for a 2026 debut,"" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said."

RIVN -12.05% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Analysts have moved to downgrade the shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday as the slump across electric vehicle stocks continues.

Electric Vehicle Stocks Decline

Shares of RIVN have declined more than 25% after the company's disappointing earnings release after the close on Wednesday. The company's production guidance also missed expectations when it said it would reduce its salaried workforce by around 10%.

Another EV company, Lucid Group, also forecast production below analyst expectations, with its share price declining more than 16% Thursday.

The misses in production guidance show the signs of a slowdown in electric vehicle demand has not yet slowed, which has also been noted by other companies in the sector, such as Ford and GM.

JPMorgan Downgrade

Reacting to the Rivian results, JPMorgan analysts said there are concerns surrounding the company's backlog, growth, pricing, and margin. They downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral, lowering the price target to $11 from $20 per share.

""We are downgrading shares of Rivian Automotive (RIVN) to Underweight from Neutral after slashing our estimates and price target to account for substantially slower growth amidst continued large losses,"" said the investment bank's analysts.

""The company has fallen far short of its own targets for vehicle sales and production, let alone the seemingly much more ebullient expectations of its investors, and disappointing new guidance revealed yesterday implies essentially no growth in 2024 (in our view strongly hinting at growing

demand problems that leave little likelihood for a re-acceleration of growth until at least 2026),"" they added.

CFRA Cuts Rivian to Sell

Elsewhere, CFRA Research also downgraded shares of Rivian to Sell from Hold, slashing their 12-month price target for the stock to $10 from $20 per share.

CFRA said the electric vehicle company's earnings miss was driven by higher-than-expected costs, as revenue of $1.32 billion came in $60 million ahead of consensus.

""From our perspective, RIVN's adjusted EBITDA guidance is mere wishful thinking, as it implies it can cut its 2023 EBITDA loss by about $1.4B this year despite lower volumes,"" wrote CFRA. ""Unfortunately, there's little RIVN can do to improve its near-term financial performance absent stronger demand."""

On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank maintained a positive outlook on Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: ), reiterating its Buy rating and a price target of $330.00.

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is playing out, according to analysts at Wedbush, who believe there is a ""tidal wave"" of spending coming to the tech industry.

Analysts explained in a note to clients that heading into 2024, there was building hype and excitement for AI, which Wedbush views as the ""biggest tech transformation since the start of the Internet.""

""Tech earnings season so far has delivered in Kelce-like fashion as the jaw dropping monetization and Copilot success seen at Redmond is the tip of the spear for AI across the broader tech industry as we predict $1 trillion of incremental tech spending over the next decade,"" analysts wrote.

""While AI starts with the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) as the only game in town from an AI chip perspective (AMD (NASDAQ: ) joining the party soon), it's all about the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th derivative of this AI Revolution,"" they added.

Analysts argue that Street numbers (and valuations) for 2024 and 2025 will move higher as this AI spending tidal wave hits the tech industry.

""It's all about the use cases exploding, which is driving this tech transformation being led by software and chips into 2024 and beyond and thus speaks to our tech bull thesis for 2024/2025,"" they stated.

Wedbush highlighted Pegasystems (NASDAQ: ), Salesforce (NYSE: ), and others as names not being given credit for incremental AI growth. Meanwhile, the firm's favorite tech names still include giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )."

CRM -0.30% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

On Tuesday, BofA Securities maintained a positive stance on Salesforce.com (NYSE: ), raising its price target to $350 from $300, while reiterating a Buy rating for the stock. This adjustment comes as a result of conversations with nearly a dozen key Salesforce partners, which indicate that deal activity for the customer relationship management giant has remained consistent with recent healthy levels.

The firm's analysis points to a spending environment that has shown signs of improvement, despite more challenging sales cycles which now often require additional executive approval. Key trends highlighted by BofA include stable Sales and Service Cloud transactions, balanced results across major industry verticals with a notable uptick in the financial sector, and a growing interest in Salesforce's Data Cloud.

BofA's outlook for Salesforce is bolstered by the expectation of sustained mid-teens top-line growth and a 200 to 250 basis point margin expansion over the next three years in an optimistic scenario. This could lead to a robust 31% compound annual growth rate in free cash flow (FCF) over the same period. Salesforce's performance has led BofA to identify it as an emerging quality Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) stock within the software sector, anticipating the company's shares will continue to re-rate higher alongside upward revisions to FCF growth projections.

The raised price objective to $350 is anchored in the anticipated fourth-quarter calculated remaining performance obligation (cRPO) upside. BofA has adjusted its enterprise value to FCF multiple from 22x to 25x, reflecting greater confidence in Salesforce's accelerating FCF growth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -No single stock has embodied the U.S. market’s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: ), leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.

The semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.

Given the company’s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.

“The response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia’s performance. “If Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.”

The company's shares were up around 12% in pre-market trading on Thursday, bringing the company closer to a $2 trillion market valuation.

Nvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That’s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market’s key drivers over the past year.

Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.

The company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the . As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.

Nvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.

Rapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.

The company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.

Nvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) or Comcast (NASDAQ: ).

Nvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.

Options wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia’s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.

While Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology. Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.

Even beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have playing up their exposure to AI. Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme."

(Reuters) -The and both surged to record closing highs on Thursday, powered by investors piling into growth and technology stocks the day after artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s bumper earnings and outlook.

For the S&P 500 benchmark, it was also the largest daily gain in 13 months. The notched its biggest single-session advance in a year and just missed a record finish.

Investors eagerly bought stocks as Nvidia shares jumped 16.4% after the chip designer forecast a roughly three-fold surge in first-quarter revenue on strong demand for its AI chips and beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue.

The company's earnings were a major test for the AI-fueled rally on Wall Street that first pushed the S&P 500 above the 5,000 point mark earlier this month. Some analysts had cautioned that disappointing results could spark a steep selloff among technology stocks.

Instead, the S&P 500 ended at a record high, gaining 105.23 points, or 2.11%, to 5,087.03, as did the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed at 39,069.11 after rising 456.87 points, or 1.18%. It was the first time the Dow has ever finished above 39,000 points.

The Nasdaq Composite added 460.75 points, or 2.96%, to 16,041.62.

""As Nvidia goes, so goes the world,"" joked Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.

He noted how Nvidia's earnings performance trounced high market expectations, showing doubters that plenty of juice was left in the AI trade after the recent rally.

""When do you sell - maybe you don't. Maybe there's still room, and I'm happy to sit and ride it out,"" Janasiewicz added.

Nvidia added $277 billion to its market capitalization, beating Meta Platform's $196 billion surge earlier this month as the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history.

Those shorting Nvidia stock were left nursing more than $2.9 billion of paper losses, per data from Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.

The benchmark index will finish this year above the 5,000 mark, according to strategists in a Reuters poll.

All but one of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, with technology stocks leading gains with a 4.4% increase. The outlier was utilities, which slipped 0.8%

The S&P 500 growth index advanced 3.3%, its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2022.

Shares of other companies, seen as beneficiaries of the AI boost, also got a shot in the arm. Nvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), server component supplier Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) and Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) jumped between 4.2% and 32.9%.

Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) soared 6.9%, to a record finish, after the software maker for chip designers reported estimate-beating earnings and outlook.

Also posting a record close was the Philadelphia Semiconductor index, with its 5% increase its largest one-day gain since October.

Big Tech and growth stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) climbed between 1.1% and 3.9%.

Elsewhere, vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ: ) jumped 13.5% after surprising investors with a fourth-quarter profit. The stock's technicals also pointed to a bullish outlook.

However, Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) tumbled 25.6% and 16.8%, respectively, after the electric vehicle startups forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on slowdown in demand.

SMCI stock price rally

Super Micro Computer, a US company that designs and builders high-performance servers, saw its share price jump more than 30% on Thursday, surging as high as $985 at one point during the session.

At the time of writing, SMCI stock was trading at around $965.1, around 9.3% short of the all-time high it hit earlier this month.

Although many questioned the sustainability of its recent rallies, the AI-related stock continues to reward its investors, gaining a staggering 1,012% over the past year.

The company has used the recent rally in its shares to announce that it will offer $1.5 billion of convertible senior notes, due 2029.

Why is SMCI stock rallying?

It appears that the Thursday jump in SMCI’s stock price was driven by company-specific news.

However, speculations suggest the rally was driven primarily by a blockbuster earnings report from Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), one of the primary catalysts behind the ongoing AI boom.

Akin to previous reports, the chipmaker demonstrated remarkable growth yet again in the fiscal Q4 2024, with revenues reaching a record $22.1 billion, marking a 265% increase from the previous year.

The company's profitability was also impressive, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) escalating by 486% to $5.16.

Moreover, Nvidia issued an optimistic guidance for the fiscal Q1 2025. It expects to hit $241 billion in revenue for that quarter, which would mark a year-over-year jump of 233%.

Nvidia’s shares popped over 15% on Thursday to $778.15, while the broader added 2%.

Although NVDA has been one of the primary drivers behind the widespread embrace of generative AI, Supermicro has quietly played a pivotal role in this trend.

Just like Nvidia's GPUs have been the driving force behind the computational capabilities powering the AI revolution, Supermicro's servers, designed specifically for AI applications, have also been significant in enabling a broad user base to leverage these advancements.

Hence the recent staggering gains in SMCI stock.

Wall Street analysts see more upside for Super Micro shares

The Thursday surge in Super Micro’s shares comes just days after Rosenblatt analysts gave the stock a vote of confidence, hiking their 12-month price target from $700 to $1,300, implying 34% further upside from the current levels.

At the time of the report release, Rosenblatt’s price target suggested an additional upside of 60% for SMCI.

Analysts attributed the upward revision to “continued momentum in AI computing.”

“Key to the story is for investors to consider that the company is benefiting not only from secular AI growth (over 50% CAGR over next several years) but material share gains,” said Rosenblatt analysts.

“We anticipate these gains to reach double digits in the next couple of years, up from the current mid-single digits, with a particular focus on enterprise,” he added."

Investing.com-- The Dow and S&P 500 notched a record close Friday, even as the rally in Nvidia cooled to blunt the broader tech sector's swashbuckling gains amid waning optimism for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts this year.

By 16:00 ET (21:40 GMT), the closed 62 points, or 0.2%, eked out gains to close at a fresh record of 5,088.85, while fell 0.3%. The three major averages closed up for the week, rising more than 1%.

Nvidia briefly joins $2 trillion club as climb continues

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) gave up the bulk of its gains to close just above the flatline after briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time, having added $277 billion in stock market value the previous day, Wall Street's largest one-day gain in history.

Nvidia's blockbuster earnings saw investors largely trade past warnings from the Federal Reserve that interest rates will stay higher for longer- a notion that was further reinforced by stronger-than-expected jobless claims data.

The gains in Nvidia helped keep losses in the broader semiconductor index in check after Super Micro Computer Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: ) gave up some gains from a day earlier.

Fed speak continues to weigh on rate-cut bets

Investors continued to rein in their expectations for aggressive rate cuts, following fresh remarks from Federal Reserve officials that point to a prolonged higher-for-longer interest-rate regime.

Federal Reserve Board Governor said on Thursday that he was in ""no rush"" to lower rates. A slew of Fed members have previously echoed this notion, citing fears of sticky inflation and strength in the labor market.

Traders are now expecting the first rate cut in June rather than May, with just four rate cuts expected, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs said that they no longer think the U.S. Federal Reserve will move to slash interest rates at its policy meeting in May following Waller's comments, now expecting the Fed to roll out its first 25 basis-point cut in June.

Investing.com -- Main U.S. indexes rose strongly Thursday after blockbuster results from AI darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) helped boost sentiment, ahead of the release of more corporate earnings and important economic data.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today

Nvidia (NVDA) stock soared 15% after the world’s most valuable chipmaker reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and outlined a bullish forecast for artificial intelligence-fueled chip demand.

Palantir Technologies (NYSE: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) all have posted hefty gains, benefiting from Nvidia's strong outlook.

Moderna (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 9.5% after the drugmaker reported a surprise fourth-quarter profit, helped by cost cutting and some deferred payments.

Etsy (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 7% after the e-commerce company warned of a fall in first-quarter gross merchandise sales on weak demand for handcrafted goods and personalized gifts sold at its online marketplace.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped over 27% after the electric truck maker reported annual production guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates and announced deep job cuts.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock rose 1% after the carrier said it has reached a tentative agreement with Transport Workers Union that represents nearly 18,000 ramp, operations, provisioning and cargo agents.

Royal Caribbean (NYSE: ) stock rose 8% after the cruise operator raised its full-year income forecast, saying it has been encouraged by both the ""demand and pricing environment"" in 2024.

Cheniere Energy (NYSE: ) stock fell 3.7% after the liquefied company posted a 38.5% fall in its full-year LNG revenue, hurt by a fall in natgas prices.

Fiverr International (NYSE: ) stock fell 9% after the online freelance marketplace missed expectations with its fourth-quarter results, while the next quarter's revenue guidance of $92.5 million also underwhelmed.

Wayfair (NYSE: ) stock rose 7% after the online furniture retailer reported a narrower-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and said it returned to positive active customer growth.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) added over $129 billion in stock market value late on Wednesday after the chipmaker's hotly anticipated quarterly report beat estimates and sparked gains in other AI hardware stocks.

Nvidia's stock jumped almost 8% after its quarterly outlook exceeded analysts' estimates, along with its January-quarter revenue and profits.

Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services. This made the Santa Clara, California company's outlook a major test of whether Wall Street's AI-fueled rally is likely to continue or potentially reverse.

Following Nvidia's report, server component supplier Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) jumped almost 6%, while Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) rose 3%.

Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology, two more chipmakers benefiting from the surge in AI computing, rose over 2% each in extended trade.

Arm Holding added nearly 6%, now up more than 160% from the $51 price set in its initial public offering in September.

Nvidia forecast current-quarter revenue of $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. That was well above the $22.17 billion predicted by analysts, according to LSEG data.

The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion, beating estimates of $20.62 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.16 vs $4.64 expected by analysts. Net income surged 769% from a year ago to $12.285 billion.

Worries that Nvidia's quarterly report might not meet Wall Street's high expectations in recent days knocked its stock down almost 9% from record highs. Its late-day surge to $724 on Wednesday still leaves its short of its $739 record high close on Feb. 14.

Including Wednesday's after-hours gain, Nvidia's stock has climbed over 40% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. In recent sessions, Nvidia has jockeyed with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) for a spot as Wall Street's third-most valuable company.

Nvidia has also recently replaced Tesla (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's most traded stock by value."

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Prices $1.5B Convertible Notes Offering

SMCI -11.84% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) (“Supermicro” or the “Company”), a Total IT Solution Manufacturer for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, today announced the pricing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes are being offered and sold to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company also granted a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes.

The Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The Convertible Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 0.7455 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $1,341.38 per share of the Company’s common stock, representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 37.5% above the closing price of $975.52 per share of the Company’s common stock on February 22, 2024). The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.

The Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 1, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a cash repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding the applicable repurchase date. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after September 1, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The Company expects to close the offering on February 27, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of various customary closing conditions.

In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and other financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the Convertible Notes.

The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially $1,951.04 per share of the Company’s common stock, which represents a premium of 100% above the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq on February 22, 2024, and is subject to customary adjustments.

In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Company’s common stock and/or purchase shares of the Company’s common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of the Company's common stock or the Convertible Notes at that time. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to the Company's common stock and/or purchasing or selling the Company’s common stock or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Convertible Notes and prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of the Convertible Notes by the Company to the extent the Company elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the Company’s common stock or the Convertible Notes, which could affect noteholders’ ability to convert the Convertible Notes, and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes, it could affect the amount and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.

The Company will receive net proceeds from the offering of approximately $1.47 billion (or approximately $1.70 billion if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in full). The Company expects to use $123.6 million (or approximately $142.1 million if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in full) of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions. The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund working capital for growth and business expansion. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes, the Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of additional Convertible Notes to fund the cost of entering into additional capped call transactions.

This press release is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the Convertible Notes or the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Any offer of these securities will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum.

The offer and sale of the Convertible Notes and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, if any, have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Chipmaker TSMC formally opens its first Japanese plant on Saturday, highlighting the Taiwanese firm's critical role in Tokyo's multi-billion dollar efforts to reboot its once-mighty semiconductor manufacturing industry.

That Japan turned to TSMC for help on an industry it once dominated reflects the Taiwan chipmaker's dominant position in the foundry business and Tokyo's heightened concern over China's growing prowess in a wide swathe of technology.

The arrival of TSMC, the world's leading contract chipmaker, in Japan is seen as having sparked investment across a sector vital to economic security even as the government eyes a greater prize with its backing for homegrown foundry venture Rapidus.

""The possibility of having TSMC build a fab in Japan really rallied support from disparate parts of the semiconductor industry,"" said Damian Thong, head of Japan research at Macquarie Capital Securities.

""They have built a snowball effect around it,"" he said.

By 2027, Taiwan is projected to control two-thirds of foundry capacity for advanced processes as its lead is eroded by aggressive expansion in the U.S., according to research firm TrendForce, with Japan increasing its global share to 3%.

TSMC, which is also building capacity in the U.S. and Germany, is targeting mass production at the fab later this year and has announced plans for a second plant, bringing total investment in the venture to more than $20 billion.

Partnering with companies including Sony (NYSE: ) and Toyota (NYSE: ), monthly capacity across the two fabs will exceed 100,000 12-inch wafers, strengthening Japan's access to chips, which are essential for the electronics, automotive and defence industries.

TSMC sees Japan as a natural fit with an industrious work culture suited to chipmaking and a government that is easy to deal with and generous with subsidies, Reuters has reported.

Japan has also benefited from Taiwan's willingness to approve the export of foundry and supply chain technology, particularly for advanced node technologies below 16 nanometres, said David Chuang, an analyst at Isaiah Research.

""With the prospect of fabricating more advanced roadmaps in Japan, it's reasonable to expect that foundry customers may be more inclined to commit to long-term development and procurement of capacity,"" said Chuang.

Japan can leverage its expertise in areas such as photoresists - chemicals that are needed for chipmaking - image sensors and packaging, which is becoming increasingly important to eke out chip performance gains, said Joanne Chiao, an analyst at TrendForce.

Momentum in Japan's chip sector is growing, with Taiwan chip companies arriving in Japan not only to support the TSMC plant but also being attracted by the industry's renewed dynamism, Reuters has reported.

ECONOMIC BOOST

In the chipmaking hub on the southern island of Kyushu where TSMC's plant is located, companies ramping up investment include power chip maker Rohm, wafer maker Sumco (OTC: ) and equipment maker Tokyo Electron.

The regional economic boost is forecast to hit 20.1 trillion yen ($134 billion) over a decade, according to the Kyushu Economic Research Center, with activity rippling out from fabs being constructed and run, and from consumption by workers.

A major bottleneck is labour shortages, said Soei Kawamura, a researcher in the business development department at the centre.

""Large companies like TSMC and Sony will be able to secure the necessary personnel, but the economic development of the Kyushu region will change depending on how many people can be recruited in the local semiconductor-related and other industries,"" he said.

The number of workers in Japan's chip-related businesses has declined by around a fifth over the last roughly two decades.

Leading domestic chip firms need to find 40,000 workers over a decade, according to estimates from the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA).

Tokyo's grander vision is of building a homegrown champion through foundry venture Rapidus, which is headed by industry veterans and targeting mass production of cutting-edge chips on the northern island of Hokkaido from 2027.

A potential rival to TSMC, which has spent decades honing its processes, Rapidus is partnering with IBM (NYSE: ) and chip research organisation Imec. But its prospects for success are viewed with scepticism by many in the industry.

""I don't doubt TSMC will be dominant, but Japan will seek to prove that they are valid as a number two,"" said Macquarie's Thong.

Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Friday and were set for a positive week as optimism over artificial intelligence drove stellar gains in the technology sector, while Chinese stocks extended a rebound into a second week.

Still, bigger gains were held back by persistent concerns over higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates, especially following strong labor market data and hawkish signals from the this week.

A market holiday in Japan also kept regional trading volumes somewhat muted, after the skyrocketed to record highs on Thursday. Even with four days of trade, the Nikkei was among the best performers in Asia this week, with a 1.6% rise.

Regional stocks took positive cues from a record-high close on Wall Street on Thursday, which was driven largely by technology stocks following consensus-smashing earnings and guidance from AI darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ). Nvidia's strong showing ramped up hopes that AI demand will spur more investment in tech this year.

Asian tech buoyed by Nvidia, AI cheer

Nvidia helped inspire consistent gains in Asian tech giants on Friday. South Korea’s rose 0.5%, supported chiefly by a 3.7% rise in memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS: ), which hit a record high at 166,900 won.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: ) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ), both key Nvidia suppliers, rose 1% and fell 0.5% in Taiwan trade, respectively. But both stocks were trading higher for the week.

Australia’s rose 0.5% on strength in tech stocks, while futures for India’s index also pointed to a positive open.

The Nifty rose 0.7% on Thursday on strength in heavyweight technology stocks, while sentiment towards India was also improved by a strong reading on the services sector.

Chinese stocks pause, but set for weekly gains

Chinese stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Friday, but were headed for a second straight week of gains, after the government rolled out a slew of supportive measures for the economy and stock market.

The and indexes moved less than 0.1% in either direction, while Hong Kong’s index fell 0.2%.

The Hang Seng was up 2.2% this week on strength in heavyweight tech and mainland stocks, while the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite were up between 3.4% and 4% for this week- their second straight week of gains after hitting five-year lows earlier in February.

Sentiment towards China was bolstered by signs of improved consumer spending during the Lunar New Year holiday, while the government also doled out more supportive measures by cutting interest rates and restricting block share sales."

Investing.com-- Shares of major Asian semiconductor companies surged on Thursday, tracking aftermarket gains in Nvidia after the chipmaker’s consensus-beating earnings and guidance fueled more hype over an AI-driven demand boom.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) rose as much as 10% in U.S. aftermarket trade after clocking , while its revenue guidance for the current quarter was also above street estimates.

Gains in the chipmaker, which is at the heart of an AI-driven surge in valuation over the past year, spilled into Asian chip stocks, particularly those with exposure to AI and Nvidia.

Japanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO: ), which is also an Nvidia supplier, rose 5.1% and was within sight of a record high. Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: )- the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a key Nvidia supplier- rose 1% and was also close to record highs.

South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ), which makes high-speed memory chips which are integral to AI development and which is also in a partnership with Nvidia, jumped nearly 4%, while Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ), also known as Foxconn, rose 0.5%.

Other chipmakers or chip-adjacent stocks advanced. Japanese tech investment giant SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO: ) rose 4.6%, tracking overnight gains in its British chip designing unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), which recently saw its market capital double on its exposure to AI.

Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO: ), Japan’s biggest chipmaker by value, rose 3.9%, while fiberglass products maker Nitto Boseki Co., Ltd. (TYO: ) jumped 8% after Morgan Stanley analysts upgraded the stock to overweight on the prospect of increased demand for special glass from the AI industry.

Semiconductor maker Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. (TYO: ) jumped nearly 10% and was the best performer on Japan’s index.

Gains in tech also saw the Nikkei reach an intraday record high, crossing levels last seen in 1989 before the unwinding of a massive speculative bubble through the 1990’s and 2000’s.

Nvidia’s earnings helped further the notion that increasing demand for AI will help push up global chip demand, which was still reeling from a sharp downturn in tech investment in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The rush into AI development was sparked largely by the release of generative AIs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT program, which had spurred several major tech firms to roll out their own, similar offerings."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's efforts to rebuild its semiconductor industry are getting a shot in the arm as more and more Taiwanese chip companies expand here - not only to support a new TSMC plant but also excited about the Japanese sector's prospects.

The influx comes amid shifting alliances and priorities in the global chip industry as the United States pushes to limit China's progress in cutting-edge semiconductors and strengthen partnerships between its allies.

Fabless chipmaker Alchip Technologies, which specialises in customised chips known as application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), is illustrative of the China decoupling trend.

In 2022, the bulk of its research and development engineers were based in China but Alchip has begun moving roles overseas, many to Japan, said a source who was briefed on the matter.

The company said it is hiring in Japan, North America and Taiwan but declined to comment further on personnel matters.

""We're expecting Japan semiconductor market growth, we're continuously capitalising on Japan ASIC opportunities and already engaging in several good projects,"" said Hiroyuki Furuzono, general manager of Alchip Japan.

At least nine Taiwanese chip firms have set up shop or expanded operations in Japan over the past two years, according to a Reuters count.

Chip design company eMemory Technology, for example, opened an office two years ago in Yokohama, which neighbours Tokyo, and has 11 employees after hiring from Japan conglomerates which once dominated the industry.

""After we built the office there we are receiving more frequent communication with the customers and they are more willing to talk in Japanese with our local people, so we see business is booming,"" eMemory President Michael Ho told Reuters.

More Taiwanese chip sector firms are also looking at increasing their presence or making their first foray into Japan, said the source and another person with knowledge of the matter, adding that a weak yen has made such decisions easier.

The sources declined to be identified as the information was not public.

PROACTIVE SUPPORT

While Japan still boasts leading semiconductor material and equipment makers, it has seen its share of the global chip manufacturing market shrink to 10% from around 50% in the 1980s after trade tensions with the U.S. and competition from South Korean and Taiwanese rivals.

But in recent years Japan has thrown huge sums to rebuild its chip manufacturing sector, recognising that semiconductors are vital for economic security and spurred on by the global chip shortage during the pandemic as well as encouragement from Washington.

This Saturday, TSMC, formally known as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, will hold the opening ceremony for its first plant on the southern island of Kyushu, a chipmaking hub.

The on-track plan contrasts with the troubled construction of TSMC's Arizona factory. It has also just announced plans for a second fab in Japan, bringing total investment in the venture to more than $20 billion.

The chipmaking giant, Reuters has reported, sees Japan as a natural fit in terms of an industrious work culture and a government that is easy to deal with and generous with subsidies.

""The core strength of a strong semiconductor country lies not just in leading firms but in a robust ecosystem,"" said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital.

""Japan's proactive government support, marked by substantial subsidies and minimal political interference, sets it apart, fostering superior progress compared to many other countries.""

In addition to TSMC, the Japanese government-backed chip foundry venture Rapidus plans to mass produce chips on the northern island of Hokkaido from 2027. Taiwan's Powerchip is also seeking government subsidies to set up a $5.4 billion foundry in Japan.

Taiwanese firms boosting their presence in Japan include TSMC-backed Global Unichip Corp (GUC), another fabless designer of ASICs, which said it is attracted by both the engineering talent and business opportunities.

Additionally, Materials Analysis Technology (MA-tek), which inspects semiconductor materials and cites TSMC as its biggest client, opened a new lab in Kyushu late last year. Semiconductor equipment and maintenance firm Finesse Technology, another key TSMC contractor, is building a factory in Japan.

TSMC supplier Marketech is also expanding in Japan, the sources said. Marketech declined to comment.

""The trend will continue for the foreseeable future as part of decoupling,"" said Takamoto Suzuki, head of China economic research for trading house Marubeni. He warned, however, that Japan may not have sufficient young science industry workers to meet demand.

The number of workers in Japan's chip-related businesses has declined by around a fifth over the last roughly two decades, although the government and universities have ramped up efforts to encourage students into the field."

By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney

(Reuters) -Intel said on Wednesday that Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) plans to use its services to manufacture a custom computing chip and that the company expects to beat an internal deadline of 2025 to overtake its biggest rival, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, in advanced chip manufacturing.

The chipmaker also gave new details on how it plans to maintain a lead over TSMC into 2026 and beyond.

Intel (NASDAQ: ) made the disclosures at an event in San Jose, California, at the first technology conference for Intel Foundry, the contract manufacturing operation it established to compete with TSMC.

Intel says it plans to retake the mantle of making the world's fastest chips from TSMC later this year with what it calls Intel 18A manufacturing technology and extend that lead into 2026 with new technology called Intel 14A.

It said Microsoft will use its 18A technology to make an undisclosed chip and that it now expects $15 billion of foundry orders, up from the $10 billion that the company had earlier told investors to expect.

The news of 14A technology is the first time that the Silicon Valley company has given details of its plans beyond the 2025. That is the deadline that Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, had set to regain the chipmaking crown when he took the reins three years ago.

For decades, Intel made chips only for itself and used its lead in manufacturing to create a cycle in which it made chips with industry-leading performance and charged a premium for them. Those margins, in turn, helped fund manufacturing advances. But when Intel lost its manufacturing lead, its chips became less competitive and margins slipped, sapping the source funding for a manufacturing rebound.

Now, Intel is counting on potentially billions of dollars in U.S. government subsidies and business from outside customers to help it get back on track.

It is hoping some customers will be enticed by its long history of operating cutting-edge factories on multiple continents, especially those with concerns about TSMC's practice of keeping its most advanced factories clustered in Taiwan.

""It's a sales pitch that's resonating right now. People want that,"" Stu Pann, the executive overseeing Intel Foundry, said of the company's geographic diversity.

Intel says it has four ""large"" customers signed up for its 18A manufacturing technology but has yet to name them. It is unclear whether Microsoft is among those financially important customers.

Intel said on Wednesday it was partnering with Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) to make it easier to make chips with Arm technologies in its factories. Intel also said it will work with the University of California Berkeley and the University of Michigan to allow students to access its 18A manufacturing technology.

Intel also has a special technology that analysts say will be useful for speeding up power-hungry artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), the leader in the AI chip market, has said it is evaluating Intel's manufacturing technology, but the two companies have not announced a deal.

Intel's effort to lure in outside customers ""is the key to the turnaround story,"" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies.

""Unfortunately, it's an unanswered question, because this is a two-to-three-year journey before we have any inkling of knowing that this is working."""

Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks retreated on Wednesday, tracking overnight weakness in Wall Street as risk sentiment wavered ahead of more cues from the Federal Reserve and key earnings from artificial intelligence giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ).

Chinese markets, however, saw extended gains as they recovered further from five-year lows. A bigger-than-expected interest rate cut by the People’s Bank of China on Tuesday also appeared to be lending some support.

Wall Street indexes closed lower on Tuesday, while futures fell in Asian trade on Wednesday as some uncertainty ahead of chipmaker Nvidia’s quarterly earnings triggered a heavy dose of profit-taking in the technology sector.

Data showed Japanese grew much more than expected in January, while shrank more than expected.

Australia’s slid 0.8%, also seeing heavy profit-taking after notching record highs earlier in 2024. Heavyweight mining stocks, particularly BHP Group Ltd (ASX: ), were the biggest weights on the index, tracking a decline in commodity prices.

On the other hand, National Australia Bank (ASX: ) rose 1.1% to a 6-½ year high on a stronger quarterly profit.

Futures for India's index pointed to a flat open.

China’s bluechip index rose 0.8%, while the added 0.9%, with both indexes pulling further away from five year lows.

Sentiment towards China was boosted by official data showing a large increase in travel demand and spending through the Lunar New Year holiday, which raised hopes for a broader recovery in spending.

Gains in mainland stocks saw Hong Kong’s index shoot up 1.9%. A bigger-than-expected by the People’s Bank on Tuesday also bolstered sentiment towards Chinese markets.

Tech skittish before Nvidia earnings

Most major Asian technology stocks tracked overnight losses in their U.S. peers, with investors turning largely cautious towards the sector in anticipation of fourth-quarter earnings from Nvidia Corp .

Markets were waiting to see whether Nvidia could deliver on forecasts of a massive spike in revenue and earnings, which in turn are likely to factor into optimism over an AI-driven boom in tech.

South Korea’s fell 0.3% on losses in heavyweight tech stocks, while Nvidia suppliers Advantest Corp. (TYO: ) and TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: ) fell 3.3% and 0.9%, respectively.

Investing.com-- Most major Asian chipmaking stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Wednesday, tracking overnight declines in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) as markets awaited more cues on an AI-driven boom from the chipmaker’s fourth-quarter earnings.

Nvidia wiped out about $100 billion in market capital on Tuesday, also seeing a measure of profit-taking as investors waited to see whether a massive earnings spike materialized as forecast by the chipmaker. The earnings will also potentially justify Nvidia’s sharp run-up in valuation over the past year.

Nvidia will report its fourth quarter earnings after the U.S. market close on Wednesday, and is expected to clock EPS of $4.58 on a revenue of $20.37 billion.

Anticipation of the earnings saw most Asian chipmaking stocks turn skittish on Wednesday. Japanese semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest Corp. (TYO: ) and TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: )- the world’s largest contract chipmaker- fell 3.2% and 1%, respectively. Both firms are major suppliers to Nvidia, with Morgan Stanley analysts stating in a recent note that TSMC's shares could be used to take a position in Nvidia for its quarterly earnings.

South Korean memory chip maker SK Hynix Inc (KS: )- which is also poised to benefit from a boom in artificial intelligence development- rose 0.5% after briefly touching a record high this week, while its larger peer Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) fell 0.1%.

Japanese tech investment house SoftBank Group Corp. (TYO: ) fell 2%, tracking an over 5% drop in the shares of its British chip designing unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), which had recently also seen a massive valuation spike on the back of AI hype.

Tokyo Electron Ltd. (TYO: ), Japan's most valuable chipmaker, fell 1.3%.

Hype over AI drove strong gains in global tech stocks in recent months, as investors bet that chipmakers and chip-adjacent firms will see higher demand on the back of increased development in generative AI.

Nvidia has been at the heart of this boom, given that it makes processors specifically geared towards running generative AI programs.

Most Asian chip stocks have largely tracked gains in Nvidia after its earnings, which have blown past expectations for three of the four quarters so far in 2023.

Elsewhere, China’s SMIC (HK: )- the country’s biggest chipmaker- surged 4.6% in Hong Kong trade on Wednesday, after a report showed the chipmaker was among the biggest recipients of government funding in 2024."

(Reuters) -Electric vehicle startups Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) forecast 2024 production well below analyst estimates on Wednesday as persistently high borrowing costs keep consumers from buying relatively pricier battery-powered cars.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ).com-backed Rivian also said it would cut its workforce by 10%.

Shares in Rivian and Lucid plummeted 15% and 8% respectively after the announcements - the latest signs of a slowdown in EV demand flagged by automakers including Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ) and market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ). The plateauing demand sparked a price war last year as companies drained margins to woo customers.

Rivian, the maker of R1T pickup trucks and R1S SUVs, is planning a weeks-long production shut down this year to upgrade its production line to improve efficiency and cut costs.

As a result, Rivian said it expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, well below estimates of 81,700 units, according to eight analysts polled by Visible Alpha. It produced 57,232 vehicles last year.

""There is a host of macro level challenges,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters, adding that high interest rates and geopolitical risks were making consumers more conscious and price sensitive.

After shying away from cutting the price of its vehicles last year, Rivian this month introduced lower-range options for its existing cars that are $3,100 cheaper.

Still, Rivian said it expects deliveries in the current quarter to be 10-15% lower than the already weak fourth quarter and that its order book had reduced due to factors including cancellations.

Rivian has been focusing on reducing its cash burn by re-negotiating supply contracts and building some components in house. Along with the cost benefits from the production line upgrade, the company said it expects margins to improve by the end of the year.

""A lot is riding on"" the company's smaller and cheaper R2 SUV that is set to be unveiled next month, Vitaly Golomb, a Rivian investor and an investment banker, told Reuters. Production is scheduled to start in 2026.

Like Rivian, Lucid is planning to start producing a mid-size car late in 2026 to attract a broader customer base, after its Gravity SUV goes into production later this year.

""With that we're going to target a $50,000 price point,"" Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said in an interview.

""Right now, we're competing with Mercedes and Porsche. When that comes out, we're going after Tesla Model Y and Model 3,"" he said, adding that he expects Lucid's total addressable market to increase 20 times.

Lucid, which has been slashing prices of its Air luxury electric sedans, also forecast production for 2024 that was much lower than Wall Street's expectations.

It expects to make 9,000 units this year, up from 8,428 vehicles in 2023. Wall Street estimated 22,594 units, according to five analysts polled by Visible Alpha."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's market regulator said on Friday that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc would fix software in 8,700 vehicles to reduce the chance of accidents.

The action involving 1,071 imported Model S and Model X and 7,629 China-produced Model 3 is described as a product recall under Chinese regulations, the regulator said. It was not immediately clear if drivers might need, or would be eligible, to return vehicles to Tesla for refunds.

Some vehicles falling under the recall have unstable rear camera integrated circuit communications owing to software issues. The driver's field of vision would therefore be affected when reversing, increasing the risk of vehicle collision and posing safety hazards, according to the regulator."

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government should block the import of low-cost Chinese autos and parts from Mexico, a U.S. manufacturing advocacy group said on Friday, warning they could threaten the viability of American car companies.

""The introduction of cheap Chinese autos - which are so inexpensive because they are backed with the power and funding of the Chinese government - to the American market could end up being an extinction-level event for the U.S. auto sector,"" the Alliance for American Manufacturing said in a report.

The group argues the United States should work to prevent automobiles and parts manufactured in Mexico by companies headquartered in China from benefiting from a North American free trade agreement. ""The commercial backdoor left open to Chinese auto imports should be shut before it causes mass plant closures and job losses in the United States,"" the report said.

Vehicles and parts produced in Mexico can qualify for preferential treatment under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement as well as qualifying for a $7,500 electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, the report noted.

The Chinese embassy in Washington said in response that China's automobile exports ""reflect the high-quality development and strong innovation of China’s manufacturing industry... The leapfrog development of China’s auto industry has provided cost-effective products with high quality to the world.""

The issue has received new interest after news reports that China's BYD (SZ: ) plans to set up an EV factory in Mexico. BYD, known for its cheaper models and a more varied lineup, recently overtook its biggest rival, Tesla (NASDAQ: ), to become the world's top EV maker by sales.

Tesla announced plans almost a year ago to build a factory in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. In October, Mexico said a Chinese Tesla supplier and a Chinese technology company would invest nearly a billion dollars in the state.

A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers has urged the Biden administration to hike tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles and investigate ways to prevent Chinese companies from exporting to the United States from Mexico.

A group of lawmakers urged U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai to boost the 27.5% tariff on Chinese vehicles and said her office ""must also be prepared to address the coming wave of (Chinese) vehicles that will be exported from our other trading partners, such as Mexico, as (Chinese) automakers look to strategically establish operations outside of (China).""

Alliance for Automotive Innovation CEO John Bozzella has said that proposed U.S. environmental regulations could let China gain ""a stronger foothold in America’s electric vehicle battery supply chain and eventually our automotive market.""

The U.S. Treasury issued guidelines in December on the $7,500 EV tax credit aimed at weaning the U.S. EV supply chain away from China."

By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) - A global slowdown in electric-vehicle demand is rippling through the industry, costing jobs and leading to changes in strategic plans, layoffs and production cuts, suggesting pain in the near term could slow the transition away from gasoline-powered combustion engines.

On Thursday, German luxury carmaker Mercedes toned down expectations on EV demand and said it will update its gasoline-powered engine vehicle lineup well into the next decade.

Mercedes delayed its goal to go all-electric by 2030. Instead, it now says it will retain combustion engines in at least half of its vehicles until then. Previously, it had hedged by saying consumer demand would dictate how soon it went all-electric.

""High interest rates, moderate oil prices, and range anxiety all have conspired against EV demand. The enthusiasm of early adopters of EVs wasn’t representative of the longer-term and broader demand for these vehicles,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, which does not own shares in any EV makers.

""We expected a reduction in demand and enthusiasm for the vehicles so we didn't find the valuations compelling,"" he added.

The pivot by Mercedes comes a day after EV startups Rivian (NASDAQ: ) and Lucid (NASDAQ: ) forecast 2024 production well below analysts' expectations and Rivian cut its workforce by 10%. That news caused shares of Rivian and Lucid to tumble on Thursday by 27.5% and 19.5%, respectively.

The pain follows last year's price war that drained margins and pressured many companies' already money-losing EV operations.

""There is a host of macro-level challenges,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that high interest rates and geopolitical risks were making consumers price-sensitive.

The situation was previously flagged by Ford (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ) and market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ), where CEO Elon Musk's warning in January of the market leader's slowing pace of growth slashed $80 billion in market value in one day.

Prices for used EVs collapsed by 16.4% in January compared with a year ago, according to Manheim Used Vehicle Value index data. Even in China, the world's largest auto market where demand for EVs has been strong, new-energy vehicle sales fell 38% in January, the first monthly drop since August 2023.

That drumbeat of bad news even has the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden set to propose a softening of limits on tailpipe emissions designed to get more Americans into EVs, sources said.

Earlier this month, Volvo (OTC: ) Cars decided to halt investments in Polestar (NASDAQ: ) after the money-losing luxury EV offshoot brand missed a 2023 delivery target.

Some industry observers argue that the long-term picture of a transition to EVs remains in place despite any short-term road bumps.

""A slowdown in the growth rate from 45% to something more sustainable is not the disaster the press has been pushing. And interest rates affect all car sales, not just EVs,"" said Vitaly Golomb, a Rivian investor and investment banker who focuses on mobility.

""The effect is more pronounced on more expensive vehicles of course and EVs still average higher price,"" he added. ""Perhaps (automakers) need to emphasize the stark difference in total cost of ownership."""

(Reuters) - Attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea have delayed cargo and sent shipping costs higher, but soft demand and ample ship availability are muting the impact on inflation, analysts from Moody's (NYSE: ) Investor Service said on Thursday.

Ships carrying everything from furniture and apparel to food and fuel are being diverted away from the nearby Suez Canal trade shortcut to the longer and more expensive route around Africa. Rerouting takes vessels and crew out of danger from drone and missile strikes by Iran-aligned Houthis supporting Palestinians as the Israel-Hamas war rages.

Container ships are the No. 1 user of the Europe-Asia Suez Canal route. Most are avoiding the Red Sea in what has become the biggest disruption to global trade since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nevertheless, the diversions are not expected to have a huge effect on inflation because they are not driven by demand, said Daniel Harlid, a transport sector analyst at the credit rating and risk analysis firm.

Rerouting ships around Africa requires anywhere from 6% to 10% more vessels, due to longer sail times slowing the return of ships to their origination points, sending on-demand spot rates on some routes up more than 100%.

Those increases came off rock-bottom levels and shipping experts expect them to normalize. That's because owners, who have new ships arriving, were struggling to fill existing vessels with cargo before the Houthi attacks began in November.

According to maritime data firm Clarksons Research, the container shipping industry's total capacity will increase by 7% to 8% in 2023 and 2024.

The automotive sector appears to be bearing the brunt of the upheaval. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and other manufacturers have temporarily paused European production due to shortages of components. On Thursday, auto parts distributor LKQ (NASDAQ: ) Corp said it was placing additional orders to shield its European operations from disruptions.

While grocers in the UK have fretted about a potential tea shortage and some fashion retailers have warned of delayed spring merchandise, they have not experienced a repeat of the pandemic shortages that resulted in empty store shelves."

By Akash Sriram

(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: ) tumbled on Thursday after their earnings reports pointed to the impact of slowing electric-vehicle demand on their costly ramp-up plans.

Rivian (NASDAQ: ) tanked 25% to a record low after it forecast flat growth in annual production, also hurt by a shutdown of its assembly line for upgrades. Lucid sank 9% as its production forecast also came below estimates.

The companies said an uncertain economic outlook and high interest rates were hitting demand for EVs, echoing remarks from market leader Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and legacy automakers like Ford (NYSE: ).

""Despite having built a highly rated and desirable EV, Rivian appears to have hit a near-term air-pocket and caught the recent EV bug,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas, who cut his price target on the stock by $10 to $20.

EV startups have been burning billions of dollars in cash in their efforts to develop, source and ramp up manufacturing of vehicles, hoping to be the next Tesla.

Rivian was set to lose more than $3.5 billion in market capitalization, if the losses hold, while Lucid's valuation was set to fall by nearly $1 billion.

Their stocks have had a weak start to the year, with Rivian down 34% and Lucid down 12%, after a tumultuous 2023 when Tesla's price war roiled the industry.

Rivian said on Wednesday it expected to post its first gross profit in the fourth quarter, after it reported a loss of about $43,000 per vehicle in the October-December period.

In comparison, Ford's Model E electric vehicle division lost an average of more than $47,000 per vehicle in the same period.

CHEAPER MODELS

Rivian is betting on the R2 sport utility vehicle set to be unveiled next month to compete with Tesla's best-selling Model Y crossover and attract customers with a smaller and cheaper EV.

But the R2 SUV, which is expected to be priced around $50,000, is set to be launched only in 2026.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said much of the upgrades to the R1 assembly line in the second quarter were made to enable the R2 vehicles.

Lucid, meanwhile, plans to start production of the Gravity SUV, with more than 400 miles of range and expected to be priced at $80,000 later this year, with larger volumes expected in 2025 onwards.

Lucid also discussed a third model in the midsize category, slated for production in late 2026, but did not provide further details on the model.

(Reuters) - Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) added over $129 billion in stock market value late on Wednesday after the chipmaker's hotly anticipated quarterly report beat estimates and sparked gains in other AI hardware stocks.

Nvidia's stock jumped almost 8% after its quarterly outlook exceeded analysts' estimates, along with its January-quarter revenue and profits.

Nvidia has been a top beneficiary of technology companies' race to build artificial intelligence into their products and services. This made the Santa Clara, California company's outlook a major test of whether Wall Street's AI-fueled rally is likely to continue or potentially reverse.

Following Nvidia's report, server component supplier Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ) jumped almost 6%, while Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) rose 3%.

Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) and Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology, two more chipmakers benefiting from the surge in AI computing, rose over 2% each in extended trade.

Arm Holding added nearly 6%, now up more than 160% from the $51 price set in its initial public offering in September.

Nvidia forecast current-quarter revenue of $24.0 billion, plus or minus 2%. That was well above the $22.17 billion predicted by analysts, according to LSEG data.

The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $22.10 billion, beating estimates of $20.62 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.16 vs $4.64 expected by analysts. Net income surged 769% from a year ago to $12.285 billion.

Worries that Nvidia's quarterly report might not meet Wall Street's high expectations in recent days knocked its stock down almost 9% from record highs. Its late-day surge to $724 on Wednesday still leaves its short of its $739 record high close on Feb. 14.

Including Wednesday's after-hours gain, Nvidia's stock has climbed over 40% in 2024 after more than tripling last year. In recent sessions, Nvidia has jockeyed with Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) for a spot as Wall Street's third-most valuable company.

Nvidia has also recently replaced Tesla (NASDAQ: ) as Wall Street's most traded stock by value."

NIO -7.69% Add to/Remove from Watchlist TSLA -2.76% Add to/Remove from Watchlist

Chinese electric vehicle company NIO (NYSE: ) saw its shares fall a further 2% Thursday, adding to its recent decline, which has seen the stock tumble towards lows not seen since 2020.

Why Nio stock is falling (near 4-year lows)

Despite a push higher in 2023 until August, the electric vehicle maker has struggled to see any upside due to various headwinds impacting the business, including supply issues and demand concerns.

In recent days, the weak production forecasts for other electric vehicle companies have also weighed on the stock.

Back in November, Nio announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce amid ""fierce competition,"" while since late 2022, Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has repeatedly cut prices in China, leading other manufacturers in the country to respond. This resulted in profit margins being squeezed.

Furthermore, the weakness in NIO's stock price can be attributed to the company's slow sales in January and concerns regarding the company's sales and earnings momentum in 2024 this year.

JPMorgan downgrades Nio stock

In a note focusing on the Chinese auto industry, JPMorgan analysts downgrade NIO to Underweight from Neutral on Friday, noting the low earnings visibility across the sector.

The bank explained that it sees downside to consensus volume/revenue estimates, while it noted that the lack of new models relative to peers may further weigh on its stock performance.

JPMorgan also highlighted that competition in the mass market may only intensify, ""especially considering the number of new launches from peers such as XPeng (NYSE: ), BYD (SZ: ), Geely (OTC: ) (Galaxy and Zeekr brands) and Great Wall.""

Nio stock forecast

Looking ahead, JPMorgan sees NIO shares hitting $5 per share after cutting the price target from $8.50 in the note.

""For 2024, our revised revenue forecast (Rmb73bn) is about 10% below Street consensus, as per Bloomberg,"" the bank stated. ""This implies that the Street's sales volume forecast would be around 220-240K units, higher than our 191K units.""

Meanfirm's Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that they remain Overweight on NIO and see it reaching $13 per share.

The investment bank believes execution still holds the key to turning the tide for the stock.

""Investors are likely to pay close attention to how NIO leverages the upsized sales team to regain growth impetus during a window period in 1H24 before the launch of its sub-brand ALPS in 2H24,"" stated the firm. ""Battery swapping and NOP+ADAS development will also be key focus areas in 2024."""

The strength of the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks has driven strong mutual fund performance at the start of 2024, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note this week.

The bank explained that following a lackluster 2023, mutual funds are off to a strong start in 2024, with 46% of large-cap mutual funds beating their respective benchmarks year-to-date (YTD), higher than the typical 38% hit rate of outperformance.

""A majority of growth (55%) and value (53%) funds have outperformed their benchmarks,"" explained Goldman Sachs. ""Small-cap funds have performed especially well: 80% have beaten the YTD with the average fund over 100 bp ahead of the benchmark.""

""Effective stock selection has allowed PMs to capitalize on a wide dispersion of returns within the Magnificent 7,"" analysts added. ""While the Magnificent 7 as a group have outperformed YTD, AAPL and TSLA's underperformance provided a boost to fund performance versus benchmarks, offsetting the drag from rallies in NVDA and META.""

Goldman Sachs also notes that while the Magnificent 7 as a group has outperformed YTD, Apple's (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) underperformance provided a boost to fund performance versus benchmarks, offsetting the drag from rallies in NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: )."

(Reuters) - The and eked out another closing record high on Friday, with all three Wall Street benchmarks scoring weekly gains, as artificial intelligence stocks had enough steam to keep the rally chugging along.

AI poster child Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) advanced again, rising 0.4%, and briefly traded above $2 trillion in market valuation for the first time.

Nvidia's gains on Thursday, the session after its blowout earnings, had propelled the chipmaker to add $277 billion in stock market value, Wall Street's largest ever daily gain. Despite a smaller advance on the final trading day of the week, its performance still dominated the market's attention.

""Nvidia is one of the key companies, if not the key company, for driving the Nasdaq and S&P 500 higher,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise.

Saglimbene noted investors have been walking back expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which otherwise could be a headwind for markets. But the performance of Nvidia and other Big Tech has pushed Fed worries into the background.

""The concentration is so intense right now on Big Tech, in particular on Nvidia, that it's looking passed that,"" he said.

Nvidia had pulled up other Big Tech and growth stocks in previous sessions, as investors traded the AI play. Some of these names gave up some gains on Friday, as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) all fell between 0.4% and 2.8%.

Shares of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), another beneficiary of the AI rally, dropped 11.8% after the server component maker priced its convertible notes.

The S&P 500 gained 1.77 points, or 0.03%, to end at 5,088.8 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 44.80 points, or 0.28%, to 15,996.82. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 62.42 points, or 0.16%, to 39,131.53.

A majority of the S&P sectors ended in positive territory. Among the best performers were utilities, as well as materials and industrials. All three climbed between 0.5% and 0.7%.

For the week, the S&P 500 climbed 1.7%, the Dow rose 1.3% and the Nasdaq finished 1.4% higher.

Carvana surged 32.1% on Friday after reporting its first-ever annual profit, helped by its pact with bondholders to cut its outstanding debt by $1 billion.

Among Friday's decliners, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) shed 9.9% on reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as the media conglomerate battled the fallout of the twin Hollywood strikes on content generation.

Jack Dorsey-led Block jumped 16.1% after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on consumer resilience.

The volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.64 billion shares, compared with the 11.6 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
